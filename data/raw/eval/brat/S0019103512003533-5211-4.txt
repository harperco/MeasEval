Having focused so far on simulations for specific high latitude magnetospheric forcing conditions, we now explore the parameter space of possible electric field and particle precipitation fluxes to examine the atmospheric sensitivity to magnetospheric forcing. Diurnally-averaged temperatures at the peak ionospheric density level (10−5 mbar) and latitude 78° from simulations R1–R18 (Table 1) are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 12 as a function of 10 keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength. As discussed in Section 3.2 (and shown for R15 in Fig. 6) the temperatures may be regarded as representing to within ±50 K exospheric and H3+ temperatures. While the values are based on equinox simulations, we found seasonal differences to be insignificant, generating temperature changes of ⩽10 K. The bottom panel of Fig. 12 shows as a function of 10 keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength the column emission rates of H3+ calculated from the vertical profiles of H3+ densities and temperatures of simulations R1–R18.
