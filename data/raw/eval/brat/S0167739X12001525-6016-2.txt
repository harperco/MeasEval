A huge advantage of Scenarios 2.* is that they do not run into any crucial SLA violation (except for Scenario 2.3), but achieve a higher utilization as compared to Scenario 3. As to the reallocation actions, of course, Scenario 1 and 3 do not execute any, but also for the autonomic management in Scenarios 2.*, the amount of executed reallocation actions for most scenarios stays below 10%. Only Scenario 2.7 executes actions in 19.8% of the cases on average of the time. Five out of eight scenarios stay below 5% on average.
