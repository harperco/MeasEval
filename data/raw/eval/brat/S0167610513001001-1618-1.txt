Fig. 5 shows θ=tan−1(w/U) against wind speed in gate closest to the height of the BT Tower (midpoint=180 m). Below the median wind speed of 7.83 m s−1 the variability in θ increases dramatically. Low wind speeds are often associated with unstable conditions where larger fluctuations in w would be more common, increasing the variability in θ. In fitting the sine function only data where the horizontal wind speed was greater than the median wind speed were used, in order to reduce the variability in θ.
