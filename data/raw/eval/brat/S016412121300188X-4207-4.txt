Fig. 5 shows the average slice size deviation when using the lower two settings compared to the highest. On average, the Low setting produces slices that are 14% larger than the High setting. Program userv has the largest deviation of 37% when using the Low setting. For example, in userv the minimal pointer analysis fails to recognize that the function pointer oip can never point to functions sighandler_alrm and sighandler_child and includes them as called functions at call sites using *oip, increasing slice size significantly. In all 30 programs, the Low setting yields larger slices compared to the High setting.
