Next, we investigated the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in iPSC-derived neural cells. Flow cytometry using antibodies against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C revealed that mature neurons on days 35 and 71 expressed only a low level of MHC-I, and that the expression was enhanced in response to interferon gamma (IFN-γ: 25 ng/ml for 48 hr; Figure 2A). The expression level of the mRNAs was approximately 1:100 compared with peripheral blood cells in both fibroblast- and blood-cell-derived iPSCs, which was again increased by exposure to IFN-γ (Figure 2B). These results suggest that donor-derived neurons could express MHC-I when INF-γ was secreted by the host brain under inflammatory conditions.
