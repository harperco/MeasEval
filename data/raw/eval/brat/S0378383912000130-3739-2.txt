For the 1.5 mm beach the agreement between model predictions and measurements is quite good after t = 2 s. At the early stages of swash, however, there is a disagreement: the experimental results show an approximately constant gradient whereas the simulation results suggest a steep increase upon the bore arrival, followed by a gradual decline. At the initial stages of infiltration, when the height of surface water is much greater than the penetration depth, hydraulic gradients are expected to be higher than later on. Furthermore, when the penetration depth is small the experimental error in evaluating gradients is large. For these reasons the discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is probably due to experimental error.
