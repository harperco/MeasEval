Great care was taken to avoid contamination of the samples by metallic impurities during the oxygen precipitation process. However, some samples were intentionally subsequently contaminated with iron, using the same procedure as in Refs. [23,34,35]. This involved rubbing the back-side of the sample with iron pieces (99.95% purity from Testbourne Limited, UK). Samples were then annealed in air in a pre-heated furnace at temperatures up to 798 °C for times chosen to ensure complete iron diffusion through the sample. Although our intention was to contaminate samples only with iron, the possibility that other transition metal impurities have entered the samples cannot be completely ruled out. Cooling was rapid, with the samples removed from the furnace at temperature and placed on a heat sink. It is estimated that samples were cooled to below ∼100 °C in <10 s. Samples which were not intentionally contaminated with iron are referred to as “uncontaminated” samples in this paper, although it is possible that the low levels of impurity contamination in such samples have significant effects, as discussed later.
