After removing data from the sonic anemometer affected by flow distortion, and correcting for a ≈0.5° tilt of the lidar, the data from the two instruments were compared. The horizontal wind speeds were averaged over 60 min to reduce variability. A strong correlation was found between the two datasets, although the lidar has a tendency to overestimate the wind speed by ≈0–0.5 m s−1 at speeds of less than 20 m s−1. At higher wind speeds there are few data, so it is not possible to draw a robust conclusion for these conditions. The error in the lidar-derived wind speeds varies with the stability of the atmosphere; from 0.36 m s−1 in stable conditions, to 1.05 m s−1 in unstable conditions, and 0.86 m s−1 in neutral conditions.
