PV modules are normally labelled with a power rating, which means the power measured at standard test conditions, STC, as defined in [1]. This is called peak-power, denoted as Wp. STC represent rather favourable operating conditions for most PV technologies as it is an unrealistic combination of a cold module temperature (25 Â°C) at a high irradiance (1000 W/m2). Different modules, even of the same technology, generally have different rated powers and the energy yields must be made comparable in any inter-comparison study. This is achieved by using the specific yield (kWh/kWp). The specific yield is a key property of PV modules at a particular location and can be a major sales argument for competing PV module suppliers.
