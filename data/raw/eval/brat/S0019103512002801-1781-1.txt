We will illustrate our tests of Liouville’s theorem using data for electrons with an energy E ≈ 90 keV and a pitch angle α ≈ 170° before they encounter Rhea. Calculations with data from different LEMMS channels give similar results. Calculations are done at constant first adiabatic invariant (μ = Esin2α(E + 2mc2)/(2mc2B)). Conservation of the second invariant is questionable, since a bounce for 170° pitch angle electrons takes about 15 s. We therefore assume, for simplicity, that the pitch angle is always the measured one, being α ≈ 170° throughout the flyby.
