Between August 2008 and October 2009 Venus Express (VEX) was in an orbit with periapsis near 86Â°N and an altitude between 185 km and 215 km with about 10 min spent in the ionosphere during each orbit. Taken collectively over many orbits the in situ ionospheric measurements cover all local time sectors, with each orbit sampling the terminator region at polar latitudes. In the current study these observations are used to determine the plasma distribution near the terminator and to show that the transport process contributes to the maintenance of the nightside ionosphere close to solar minimum.
