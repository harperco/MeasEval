Moore et al. (2010), in the light of additional Cassini RSS observations, revisited their k1∗ rate and concluded that the best fit between model and observations was obtained when multiplying the original reaction rate of Moses and Bass (2000) by a factor of 0.125 which, with a revised average base reaction rate (from k1 = 2 × 10−9 to k1 = 1 × 10−9 cm3 s−1) (Huestis, 2008), corresponds effectively to a reduction of the assumed volume mixing ratio of H2(ν⩾4) by a factor of 4 with respect to that assumed by Moses and Bass (2000). For a more detailed discussion see Moore et al. (2010) and Galand et al. (2011).
