The toughening events of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers can be summarised as localised shear-banding of the epoxy polymer initiated by the particles and internal cavitation of the S-CSR particles (which relieves the triaxial stress-state in the vicinity of the crack tip) followed by void growth. These events contribute to the relatively high toughness measured from the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers. The differences observed at low temperatures indicate that the increase of the cavitational resistance of the S-CSR particles delays the cavitation process and enhances the localised shear-band yielding process. The increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer attenuates the deformation of the polymer and reduces the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip, but this effect is compensated for by the increased energy absorption from the enhanced shear-band yielding. Hence, there is a reduction of the toughening performance of the S-CSR particles at low temperatures, but the competition between these effects results in the fracture energy being independent of the test temperature between −55 °C and −109 °C.
