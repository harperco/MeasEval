Table 1 presents the percentage of MEX orbits that we observe the different combinations of energy distribution asymmetries. In total, ASPERA-3 observes electron precipitation signatures on 43.0% of MEX orbits at Mars. The signatures of unaccelerated electron precipitation from electron spikes make up ∼70% of this total, occurring on 29.8% of MEX orbits, and are therefore the most common form of electron precipitation signature at Mars. This compares to signatures of accelerated electron precipitation from peaked electrons and “inverted-V” electrons, which occur on 9.8 and 3.4% of MEX orbits, respectively. This suggests a similarity to the Earth where the diffuse aurora from the precipitation of unaccelerated electrons accounts for a much larger amount of the precipitating flux of particles onto the atmosphere than discrete aurora (Newell et al., 2009).
