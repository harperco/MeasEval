Efficient generation of FAP-specific iPS cells by SeV vectors. (A) ALP staining of cells growing on 100-mm dishes. (B) RT-PCR analysis of expression of NANOG, TERT, SeV, and β-actin. iPS-1 to iPS-10 are established clones. (C) Typical staining of FAP-specific iPS cell colonies with anti-SeV antibodies. The colony was partially positive (left panel) and negative (right panel) for SeV. BC, bright contrast. Scale bar, 50 μm and 100 μm. (D) Immunostaining of established clones with pluripotency marker Oct3/4 (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). BF, bright field. Scale bar, 100 μm.
