The numerical predictions of surface and subsurface flow behaviour for a bore-driven swash on two permeable coarse-grained beaches (1.5 mm and 8.5 mm sediment) are in good agreement with large-scale laboratory swash measurements. The numerical results capture the main swash flow features and wetting front profiles in uprush and backwash, and give good predictions of hydraulic gradient and infiltrated volume time-series across the swash zone for both beaches. The numerical predictions of the pore-air pressure build-up within the two sediments are in good agreement with the large-scale laboratory measurements. The time when pressure first changes (i.e. the arrival of the pressure front) is well-predicted across the swash zone, as are the magnitudes of pressure head during uprush and backwash. The numerical model captures well the groundwater response to surfaceâ€“subsurface water exchange, with reasonable agreement between the model-predicted and measured exit point during the backwash. Discrepancies between model and experimental results are primarily due to the relatively simple parametrisation of the bed shear stress for the surface flow and the approximation of the subsurface flow as (coupled) one-dimensional processes.
