a. Profiles of TKE corresponding to selected magnitudes of depth-averaged velocity during uprush (+), during backwash before time of maximum backwash velocity (‚óè) and during late backwash (x). Horizontal lines indicate corresponding measured water depths during uprush (-), during backwash before time of maximum backwash velocity (--) and during late backwash (-.-.). Results are shown for the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach at x = 0.072 m (top panel), x = 0.772 m (middle) and x = 1.567 m (bottom). b. TKE profiles for the 8.4 mm gravel-rough beach. See caption Fig. 15a for details.
