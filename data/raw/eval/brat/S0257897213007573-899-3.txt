The Raman features of the CVD layer are similar to that of the CDC layer, although the position of D-band shifts to the higher wavenumber at ~ 1354 cmâˆ’ 1. Since the CVD carbon nucleates and grows on the top of CDC layer, top layer may copy the structure of CDC layer in some extent and therefore their Raman feature is similar. The up-shifted D-band of CVD layer may be attributed to the increased size of the graphite microcrystalline. It is also necessary to note that the densification of the CVD layer and the reduced internal stress may lead to the difference in Raman spectrum. The Raman spectrum of the CVD layer was also fitted with 2 + 2 Gaussian mode. The integrated intensity ratio (ID/IG) reduces to 1.32, corresponding to an increased La of 3.75 nm compared to CDC layer.
