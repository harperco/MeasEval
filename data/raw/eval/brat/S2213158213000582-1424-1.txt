As noted in the Introduction, Naatanen and Picton (1987) argued that the electric N1 reflects contributions from frontal sources as well as from primary auditory cortex. Present results provide confirmation of these findings, with frontal activity observed in both groups (Fig. 2). Findings are also consistent with imaging studies that have observed frontal activity during auditory tasks.22Although many paired-click studies have examined the association between frontal activity and gating measures (e.g., second click divided by first click), studies examining associations between paired-click ratio scores and frontal activity but not also associations between first click activity and frontal activity are not discussed as findings between ratio scores and frontal activity are outside the scope of this study (e.g., EEG studies such as Williams et al. (2011) and fMRI studies such as Tregellas et al. (2007) and Mayer et al. (2009)). For example, examining auditory responses in patients with epilepsy using intracranial microelectrode grids, Korzyukov et al. (2007) detected 50 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity, findings consistent with earlier corticography studies suggesting frontal contributions to P50 (Grunwald et al., 2003). Boutros et al. (2011) also detected 100 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity using subdural electrodes. Similar to present findings in controls, Boutros et al. observed activity in the posterior part of STG and in left ventral prefrontal cortex (more exact comparisons between the two studies in terms of frontal activity are difficult, as many subjects in Boutros et al. did not have electrodes placed in anterior frontal regions). Boutros et al. (2011) also observed 100 ms auditory activity in middle temporal gyrus, parietal, cingulate, and occipital regions. Activity observed in similar but not identical locations in these other areas in the present study may be due to the significant latency variability Boutros et al. (2011) observed in several regions. Variability across subjects in the location of activation may also account for study differences.
