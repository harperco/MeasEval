For the DSC measurements, 14 samples, taken from three different positions of the HPT disk, were prepared. Six samples were cut from the disk at a radius of r=9mm at different heights. Four samples were prepared at radii of r = 9.3 and r = 7.3 mm. The measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer DSC7 differential calorimeter, which determines the heat release for the annealing processes at different linear heating rates. A subsequent re-run served as the reference measurement and baseline for the analysis (for details see Ref. [13]).
