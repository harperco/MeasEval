A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.
