The XPS analysis also reveals low calcium phosphate levels in the PLGA–HA samples, despite the fact that the fibres are filled with a large amount of nanoparticles. Since XPS is a surface chemical analysis technique (with analysis depth less than 10 nm), this suggests that the nanoparticles lying at the surface of the fibres were embedded in a thin layer of polymer. The presence of carbon observed by XPS at the surface of the HA nanoparticles might result from atmospheric contamination by CO2 and volatile fatty acids. At the surface of the CaP fibres, an additional reason for the presence of carbon might be the existence of residual atoms from the degradation–evaporation of the PLGA polymer. This would explain the higher proportion of carbon when compared to the native HA nanopowder and why the ratio of oxygen to carbon is lower. The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature. For pure HA, this reaction is known to occur at sintering temperatures below 1200 °C with a conversion degree of 0.4 to 0.5 [25]. A simple way to present the reaction formula for dehydroxylation would beCa10(PO4)6(OH)2→Ca10(PO4)6O+H2O
