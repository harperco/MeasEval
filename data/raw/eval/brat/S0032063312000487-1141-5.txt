We initially made the assumption that all crossing normals were related to wave activity, even those not part of a clear oscillation. Thus the temporal sense of a crossing associated with a normal (inbound/outbound) and the tilt of the measured normal with respect to the model normal (sunward/antisunward) tells us if the assumed waves were propagating sunward or tailward. Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 9 show the results of this exercise. 77% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 77% of the dawn side crossings and 76% of the dusk side crossings. Considering that not all of the crossings were necessarily crossings of a boundary perturbed by surface waves, these results support predominantly tailward wave propagation. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show the inferred propagation directions for the crossings associated with waves only. In this case, 89% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 94% of the dawn side crossings and 86% of the dusk side crossings. The wave-associated crossings that suggest sunward propagation are all relatively close to the subsolar region.
