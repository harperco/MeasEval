Rates of oxygen consumption were assessed in coral fragments placed within 220 mL incubation chambers fitted with oxygen optodes connected to a temperature-compensated oxygen analyser (Oxy-4 Mini with Temp-4, Presens & Loligo systems). Magnetic stirrers ensured homogeneity of oxygen around the coral fragments. Chambers were filled with tank seawater and corals were allowed to acclimate to the conditions for 2 h. Ten chambers were used per treatment at each time point; 8 for respiration, and 2 as seawater ‘blanks’ in order to measure (and subsequently subtract) background microbial respiration. Prior to respiration measures, corals were not fed for 48 h. Once chamber lids were attached ensuring no headspace, oxygen consumption was recorded for a 40-min period for each fragment, during which oxygen saturation did not fall below 80%. Following incubations at T+21 days, fragments were removed and preserved at −20 °C for subsequent weight determination.
