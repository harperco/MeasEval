Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRIâ€“fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1. However, by combining the fMRI and sMRI classifiers, the two groups of subjects were separable with a diagonal line as shown in the figures.
