Site conditions: imperfections in a turbine's surroundings are not considered in our model; for example: turbulence intensity, terrain slope, blockage effects, blade fouling (by dirt, ice, insects, etc.), or masking by surrounding terrain. These impacts are highly site specific and hard to quantify with a single factor, with the only source we found estimating that they reduce output by 2â€“5%, plus 1% per 3% increase in turbulence intensity [36].
