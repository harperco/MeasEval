The Jovian upper atmospheric temperature is up to 700 K higher than that predicted by solar heating alone (Strobel and Smith, 1973; Yelle and Miller, 2004). This ‘energy crisis’ at Jupiter and the other giant planets has puzzled scientists for over 40 years. Different theories have been put forward to explain Jovian upper atmospheric heating: gravity waves (Young et al., 1997), auroral particle precipitation (Waite et al., 1983; Grodent et al., 2001), Joule heating (Waite et al., 1983; Eviatar and Barbosa, 1984) and ion drag (Miller et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2005; Millward et al., 2005). None of the aforementioned studies have been able to fully account for the observations.
