In previous work (Binkley and Harman, 2005), we introduced the study of dependence clusters in terms of program slicing and demonstrated that large dependence clusters were (perhaps surprisingly) common, both in production (closed source) code and in open source code (Harman et al., 2009). Our findings over a large corpus of C code was that 89% of the programs studied contained at least one dependence cluster composed of 10% or more of the program's statements. The average size of the programs studied was 20KLoC, so these clusters of more than 10% denoted significant portions of code. We also found evidence of super-large clusters: 40% of the programs had a dependence cluster that consumed over half of the program.
