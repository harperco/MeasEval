Human MRPL12 is 27.5% identical in amino acid sequence to the previously crystallized T. maritima L12 ribosomal protein. The C-terminal domain (CTD) (107 to end in Escherichia coli) is conserved in evolution [50] and is required for initial binding and GTPase activation for both EF-Tu and EF-G. Indeed, both EF-Tu and EF-G have greatly diminished GTPase activity on ribosomes lacking the CTD of L12 [51,52]. Superimposition of MRPL12 with the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome (PDB code: 2WRL) lacking L7/L12 stalk proteins shows that MRPL12 Ala181 is located within this highly conserved region (Fig. 3A). Moreover, modeling of MRPL12 shows Ala181 positioned in a helix potentially involved in translation factor interactions (Fig. 3A/B). Bacterial L7/L12 CTDs also contain a number of strictly conserved residues that are involved in the initial contact with elongation factors [52,53] and crucial for translation [54]. Alanine is one of the best helix forming residues and substitutions can therefore have profound energetic effects by perturbing packing interactions or tertiary contacts [55]. Thus, the p.Ala181Val change might be predicted to alter interactions with the elongation factors, and since MRPL7/12 bound to elongation factors is predicted to have a higher affinity for the ribosome [54], the mutation may in turn affect both rate and accuracy of mitochondrial translation.
