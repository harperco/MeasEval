In order to test convergence with time discretisation a sequence of time steps is considered. As in Shi et al. (2001) the sequence is given by ∆t/i with ∆t = 0.2 m and i = 1,2,…,10. Spatial discretisation is constant at ∆x = 0.2 m for all the tests. Fig. 16 shows convergence rates with time refinement. The average Rij obtained is 2.33. This value obtained with the proposed third-order Runge–Kutta scheme is similar to that obtained by Shi et al.(2003) with a fourth-order Adams–Bashforth–Moulton predictor–corrector scheme. It has to be noted that unlike the latter scheme, the proposed Runge–Kutta scheme allows an adaptive time-stepping as suggested by Shi et al. (2012).
