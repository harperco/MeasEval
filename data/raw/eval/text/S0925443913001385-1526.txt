RNA was isolated from fibroblasts using Trizol following manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Northern blots were performed as described [48]. Briefly, aliquots of RNA (5 Î¼g) were electrophoresed through 1.2% (w/v) agarose under denaturing conditions and transferred to GenescreenPlus membrane (NEN duPont) following the manufacturer's protocol. Radiolabelled probes were generated using random hexamers on PCR-generated templates corresponding to internal regions of the relevant genes.
