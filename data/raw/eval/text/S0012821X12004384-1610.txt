The brief peak in Apectodinium, AOM and low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (Deflandrea) at 2617.4 m (Fig. 7) indicate a sporadic episode of surface water freshening/eutrophication before the CIE, which is best explained by an increase in regional precipitation due to its rapid nature. A coincident reduction in I. hiatus swamp conifers indicates possible disturbance of nearby coastal environments possibly from flooding (see Section 4.5). An associated reduction in Î´13C may have been caused by stratification of the North Sea from an enhanced halocline, trapping 12C-enriched organic carbon at depth. This scenario may also explain the other peaks in Apectodinium at 2619.6 and 2614.7 m (although see Section 4.1).
