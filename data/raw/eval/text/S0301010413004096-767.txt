INS spectra were recorded on the TOSCA spectrometer at the ISIS Neutron Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK) for energy transfers between ∼−2 and 500 meV. In this region TOSCA has a resolution of ∼1% ΔE/E. The sample of desolvated NOTT-300 (∼2.5 g) was loaded into a cylindrical vanadium sample container and connected to a gas handling system. The sample was degassed at 10−7 mbar and 120 °C for 1 day to remove any remaining trace guest solvents. The temperature during data collection was controlled using the instrument built-in cryostat and electric heaters (5 ± 0.2 K). The loading of para-H2 (99.5%) was performed volumetrically at 40–50 K in order to ensure that H2 was adsorbed into NOTT-300. Subsequently, the temperature was reduced to 5 K in order to perform the scattering measurements with the minimum achievable thermal motion for H2 molecules.
