If the sonic anemometer is to be used to evaluate the accuracy of the lidar-measured wind speeds, confidence in the accuracy of the wind speeds measured by this instrument must be high. In a previous study Barlow et al. (2011b) carried out wind tunnel simulations of the flow around BT Tower and the lattice tower on which the anemometer is located. During these simulations it was observed that both the tower and the lattice distorted the flow at the position of a sonic anemometer installed on top of the lattice, and correction factors were developed for this position. These correction factors cannot be directly applied to the data presented here, as the sonic anemometer has been moved since the original installation. Although the corrections applied by Barlow et al. (2011b) were small (â‰ˆ2% of the mean wind speed), data from the sonic anemometer are examined here to determine whether flow distortion has a substantial effect on the instrument in this new position. Since the new position is higher, and therefore further from the lattice tower, it is expected that any error will be smaller.
