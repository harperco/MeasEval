Watchdog timers. For each state s∈S, there can be watchdog timers (T,s,C) at node i, where T∈R+ is the duration of the timer and C is a clock. The watchdog timer has input port Si,i and a binary output port TimeT,s,C. The timer's module specification ΦTime is defined as follows. Let Ein be an execution of the timer's input port Si,i and Eout an execution of its output port TimeT,s,C. Then Eout∈ΦTime(Ein), iff the following holds:–(Clock) Clock C is correct at all times, i.e., t′−t⩽C(t′)−C(t)⩽ϑ(t′−t) for all t,t′∈R, t<t′.–(Reset) There exists a (binary) signal σT,s,C∈[TimeT,s,C] (the equivalence class of the output port's signal) such that, for each time ts∈R when Si,i switches to state s, there is a time t∈[ts,ts+dTime] such that (T,s,C) is reset, i.e., event (0,t)∈σT,s,C. This is a one-to-one correspondence, i.e., for each such ts this time t is unique and (T,s,C) is not reset at any other times.–(Expire) Denote by R⊂R the set of times when (T,s,C) is reset. For each time tR∈R, denote by tE(tR) the unique time satisfying that C(tE(tR))−C(tR)=T. Then, for each t∈R, TimeT,s,C(t)=0 iff t∈⋃tR∈R[tR,tE(tR)). Iff (tE(tR),1)∈TimeT,s,C, i.e., (T,s,C) is not reset during (tR,tE(tR)] again and hence TimeT,s,C switches to 1 at time tE(tR), we say that (T,s,C) expires at time tE(tR). (T,s,C) is expired at time t∈R iff TimeT,s,C(t)=1. For notational convenience, we will omit the clock C and simply write (T,s) for both the timeout and its signal.
