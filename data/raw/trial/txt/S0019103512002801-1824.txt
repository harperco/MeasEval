The relative strength of the observed ∣B∣ disturbances at Rhea with respect to the background ∣B∣ is between 6% and 13%, compared to 6–8% at Enceladus, where non-dipolar drifts appear to be important (Krupp et al., 2012). Complex drifts may help energetic electrons access the wake (enhancements), or lead to the formation of forbidden regions (flux dropouts). We therefore believe that the role of complex drifts at Rhea should be investigated.
