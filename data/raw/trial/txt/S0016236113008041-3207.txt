Elemental impurities have three possible locations for bonding in CaCO3 [26]: Substitution via cation exchange for Ca2+ occurs for 90â€“95% of elements e.g., Fe, Mn, and Sr. Adsorption onto crystal faces to balance charge inbalances e.g., Na, and K. Inclusion of additional mineral phases within the CaCO3.
