Once again, the differences between the earlier models and our work arise from different boundary conditions, and assumptions regarding heating rates and photochemistry. We demonstrate this by reproducing the results of Murray-Clay et al. (2009) with our model. In order to do so, we set the lower boundary to 30 nbar with a temperature of 1000 K, and included the substellar tide in the equations of motion. We only included H, H+, and electrons in the model, and used the recombination rate coefficient and Lyman α cooling rate from Murray-Clay et al. (2009). We also calculated the heating and ionization rates with the gray approximation by assuming a single photon energy of 20 eV for the stellar flux of 0.45 W m−2 at the orbital position of HD209458b. Fig. 10 shows the density profiles of H and H+ based on this model (hereafter, the MC09 model).
