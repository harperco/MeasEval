Fig. 10 shows how gaseous major element concentrations were affected by flue gas SO2 concentration. Concentrations of all were very low at <1 ppm, with Fe and Si present in the highest concentrations at 0.63 and 0.51 ppm respectively. For several elements, 1000 ppm SO2 resulted in either the highest concentrations, as was the case for Na, Al, and Si, or the lowest concentrations, as was the case for Fe, when compared to 0 and 2000 ppm SO2.
