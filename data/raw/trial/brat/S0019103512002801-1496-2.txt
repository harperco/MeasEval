Certain channels of LEMMS can accumulate counts with sixteen times higher temporal resolution than the typical rate channel time resolution (∼5.7 s). These are called priority channels. The available priority channels for each flyby are given in Table 1. We will distinguish rate and priority channels using the suffix “_PRIO” for the latter (e.g. C1_PRIO). Priority channels are especially useful for the identification of short duration structures, such as the small scale flux dropouts near Rhea (Jones et al., 2008).
