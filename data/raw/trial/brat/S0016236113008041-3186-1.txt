Fig. 7 shows solid concentrations of trace elements, of which only Rb, Nb and W were found at concentrations greater than 0.1 ppm. W showed the greatest change, with concentration increasing from 0.06 to 0.42 to 0.74 ppm for inventories 4.5, 6 and 13 kg respectively. All trace element flue gas concentrations were found at a concentration of <0.1 ppm and therefore considered negligible.
