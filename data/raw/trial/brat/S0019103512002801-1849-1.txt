In the tracings shown in Fig. 10, 350 electrons were injected at the left boundary. The top right panels show electrons at the 1% level of Erk (1 keV). They practically follow the plasma flow pattern as magnetic drifts are unimportant at low energies. Electron trajectories “grazing” the wake boundaries expand into the wake due to flow perturbations. The wake then becomes narrower than the moon’s diameter.
