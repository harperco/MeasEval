Cleaned sponge and diatom opal was dissolved via wet alkaline digestion (Cardinal et al., 2007; Ragueneau et al., 2005) in 0.2 M NaOH at 100 °C for 40 min (diatoms) or up to 1 week (sponge spicules). The samples were acidified to pH∼2 with 0.2 M thermally distilled HCl and separated from major ions using cation exchange resin (BioRad AG50W-X12, Georg et al., 2006). Silicon isotope analysis was carried out using a Nu Instruments Nu-Plasma HR multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer run in medium resolution mode (m/Δm∼3500 at 5% and 95%). Samples were introduced via a self-aspirating PFA microconcentric nebuliser (ESI) in a Cetac Aridus II desolvating unit. Measurements included six to eight standard-sample brackets (brackets where the rate of machine drift outstripped bracketing rate were disregarded), each composed of twenty eight-second integrations. Samples were measured relative to the NIST RM 8546 standard. The external diatomite standard (1.26±0.2‰, Reynolds et al., 2007) yielded a mean and 2SD of 1.23±0.25‰ (n=104). Error bars in the figures and text are this 2SD external reproducibility unless the internal reproducibility of the standard sample brackets was larger, in which case this is quoted instead.
