Results of ICP-MS flue gas analysis provided in Fig. 5 show that most of the major elements present in the carbonator flue gas increase with the mass of the limestone in the reactor. However, some elements are only present for the largest bed inventory of 13 kg e.g., Ti, Cr, and Mn. However, all elements included within Fig. 5 can be considered to be at very low concentrations of <2 ppm.
