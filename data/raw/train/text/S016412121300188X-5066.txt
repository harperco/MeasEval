This paper extends our previous work which introduced coherent dependence clusters (Islam et al., 2010b) and decluvi (Islam et al., 2010a). Previous work established the existence of coherent dependence clusters and detailed the functionalities of the visualization tool. This paper extends previous work in many ways, firstly by introducing an efficient hashing algorithm for slice approximation. This improves on the precision of previous slice approximation from 78% to 95%, resulting in precise and accurate clustering. The coherent cluster existence study is extended to empirically validate the results by considering 30 production programs. Additional case studies show that coherent clusters can help reveal the structure of a program and identify structural defects. We also introduce the notion of inter-cluster dependence which will form the base of reverse engineering efforts in future. Finally, we also present studies which show the lack of correlation between coherent clusters and bug fixes and show that coherent clusters remain surprisingly stable during system evolution.
