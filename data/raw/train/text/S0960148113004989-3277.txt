The final scenario (Fig. 3d) was solved with the non-stationary shallow water equations. The simulation time consisted of one P = 12 h sinusoidal period with a time step of Δt = 864 s. No spin up phase was applied, as its effect is assumed to be small due to the relatively short extent of the domain. Dirichlet boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries enforced the following sinusoidal in-/outflow velocity:u(x,y,t)=(−2sin(2πt/P)0).
