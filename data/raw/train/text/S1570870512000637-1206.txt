[42] believe that the natural evolution of the Internet should be to harness multipath-capable end systems in order to achieve resource pooling. [9] show that opportunistic networks typically exhibit the path explosion phenomenon. In our work, the nodes benefit from pooling the capacity of their many and varied contacts, making effective use of the network resources available to them. If traffic is spread across the resources of a nodeâ€™s many and varied contacts in the right way, with the right reaction to the right congestion signals from the network, then traffic can quickly move away from congested regions.
