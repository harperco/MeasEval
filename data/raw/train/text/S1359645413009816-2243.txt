Crystallite sizes were determined by a scanning electron microscope (LEO 1525 field emission scanning electron microscope, with a nominal resolution of 1.5 nm at 20 kV) equipped with a backscattering detector. For correlating the dilatometric length changes with modifications of microstructure, microscopy samples were prepared from the same part of the HPT disk as the dilatometric samples and subsequently annealed under identical conditions in the dilatometer up to predefined temperatures at a heating rate of 5 K/min, followed by rapid cooling to ambient temperature at a rate of about 30 K/min.
