Our model consists of a two-dimensional square system, with pre-set side length of L = 1 m, containing N = 1000 discrete particles. The overall coverage of particles in the material is given by the number density, λ = N/L2 (fixed at 1000 m−2) and the area fraction, Af=λa¯, where a¯ is the mean cross-sectional area of a particle. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the edges of the system to reduce finite size effects [22]. Our choice of units is irrelevant to the dispersion quality.
