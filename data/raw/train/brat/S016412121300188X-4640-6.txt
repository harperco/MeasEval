Indent  has one extremely large coherent cluster that spans 52.1% of the program's vertices. The cluster is formed of vertices from 54 functions spread over 7 source files. This cluster captures most of the logical functionalities of the program. Out of the 54 functions, 26 begin with the common prefix of “handle_token”. These 26 functions are individually responsible for handling a specific token during the formatting process. For example, handle_token_colon, handle_token_comma, handle_token_comment, and handle_token_lbrace are responsible for handling the colon, comma, comment, and left brace tokens, respectively.
