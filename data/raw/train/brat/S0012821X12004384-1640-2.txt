A negative carbon isotope excursion of 5‰ has been identified from δ13CTOC and δ13CAOM in an expanded Paleocene–Eocene boundary section from the central North Sea Basin. Palynological (dinoflagellate cyst, pollen, and spore assemblages) and sedimentologic (C/N ratios and kaolinite distribution) evidence indicate major changes occurred to marine and terrestrial environments in NW Europe both preceding and over the CIE. Enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input from 4 m before the CIE may indicate tectonic uplift and oceanic restriction of the North Sea, supporting hypotheses for NAIP volcanism as a trigger for the CIE (Svensen et al., 2004), and/or increased terrigenous runoff and regional precipitation, supporting hypotheses of an enhanced hydrologic cycle triggering carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002). A peak in Apectodinium before the CIE is interpreted as an ephemeral increase in terrestrial runoff causing local eutrophication. Further enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input at and immediately after the CIE onset, coupled with evidence for sea level rise in coastal areas, indicate possible increased regional precipitation over NW Europe. At this location (paleolatitude 54 oN) increased precipitation would support the hypothesis that a poleward migration of storm tracks from an enhanced hydrologic cycle resulted from global warming during the PETM (Pagani et al., 2006b).
