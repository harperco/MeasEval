The boundary conditions were as follows. On the top, bottom and right boundaries a no-slip boundary condition was applied. On the left boundary a Dirichlet boundary condition enforced a sinusoidal in-/outflow velocity:u(x,y,t)=(−2sin(2πt/P)0),where P is the tidal period time. Due to the small basin size, a realistically long tidal period would lead to an excessively large tidal range. Therefore, the tidal period was defined to be P ≡ 10 min, which resulted in a tidal range of ±12 m. The simulation time was set to one full tidal period with a time step of Δt = 12 s. No spin up phase was applied, as its effect is assumed to be small due to the relatively short extent of the domain.
