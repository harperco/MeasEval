For Na, Al, K and Fe, the lowest bed inventory of 4.5 kg resulted in a concentration in the flue gas which was less than that of the blank sample, values which then increased for the higher bed inventories. This suggests that a certain amount of these elements is being absorbed, perhaps by the sorbent in the case of Fe, or by the reactor itself. In the case of P, decreased values compared to the blank were found for bed inventories of 4.5 kg and 13 kg, but an increased value for 6 kg inventory. However, the values are very low at <0.01 ppm and this anomalous result may be due to analytical errors. Overall, although concentrations in the flue gas are small at <2 ppm, increasing bed inventory does appear to increase the concentration of the majority of major elements present in the flue gas.
