This longitudinal study of British adults shows that manifest cardiovascular disease (CHD and stroke) is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. There was also some evidence to suggest an association between higher Framingham stroke risk score and increased onset of depressive symptoms before the age of 65 years. However, the vascular risk scores did not predict later-life depressive symptoms among persons with no manifest vascular disease or history of depression. This finding was based on data from three different vascular risk prediction algorithms—the Framingham CVD, CHD, and stroke scores—and depressive symptoms measured using two survey instruments and information on use of antidepressant medication.
