As expected our design did not deadlock whereas a conventional unit deadlocked roughly 2% of the times that a glitch appears. This is very significant as a single deadlock has the potential to cripple a link permanently (until the whole system is rebooted). Given the communication-intensive application model supported by SpiNNaker this would mean a network becoming highly degraded very quickly if glitches appeared.
