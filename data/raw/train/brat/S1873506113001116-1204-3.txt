It has not been reported whether the significantly simplified E8 medium is sufficient to support the survival and proliferation of undifferentiated hPSCs in suspension culture. Thus our studies began by establishing a static suspension culture condition in E8 medium for serial passaging and expansion of hiPSCs. BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007). The cells survived and formed convex dish-shaped aggregates within 24 h due to the gravity force (Fig. 1a). The size of the cell aggregates gradually increased corresponding to the cell number along the culture period. BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7 ± 0.9 fold per passage, 3.7 × 106 fold increase in total with > 99% of the cells being TRA-1–60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c). We also examined the differentiation potential of expanded cells, using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008). We found that under the hematopoiesis-inducing condition, leukocyte-like cells emerged around day 10 (Fig. 1d) with 46.8% ± 1.6% of the cells becoming CD34+CD45+ HPCs (Fig. 1e). These results indicate that undifferentiated hiPSCs can be expanded in suspension in E8 medium supplemented with one-day treatment of Y27632, and retain their differentiation potential.
