Two stock solutions of each standard compound were made; for AB, As(III), DMA and MMA the concentrations were 100 mg/L and 1 mg/L and for As(V) the concentrations were 10 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L. The stock solutions were prepared in nitric acid (1%), with the exception of As(III), in which concentrated hydrochloric acid was used to promote its dissolution. The final standard concentrations for all compounds were 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Î¼g/L in 1% nitric acid.
