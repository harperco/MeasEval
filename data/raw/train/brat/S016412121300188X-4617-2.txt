The next case study uses indent  to further support the answer found for RQ4 in the acct  case study. The characteristics of indent  are very different from those of acct  as indent  has a very large dominant coherent cluster (52%) whereas acct  has multiple smaller clusters with the largest being 11%. We include indent  as a case study to ensure that the answer for RQ4 is derived from programs with different cluster profiles and sizes giving confidence as to the generality of the answer.
