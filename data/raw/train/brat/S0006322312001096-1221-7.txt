We constructed Framingham CVD, CHD, and stroke risk scores for each participant and used logistic regression to examine the association of each risk score at baseline with depressive symptoms at follow-up. Crude, age- and sex-adjusted, and multivariably adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals per 10% absolute increase in risk score were calculated. In the analysis of GHQ symptoms, the sample was large enough to detect, with 90% power at a significance level of .05, an odds ratio of 1.14 for a 10% increase in the Framingham CVD risk score. For depressive symptoms defined by CES-D and antidepressant medication, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.40 and 1.24, respectively.
