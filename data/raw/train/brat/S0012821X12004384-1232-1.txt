As 22/10a-4 is in the deep (>0.5 km) central part of the basin, it acted as a depocentre and exhibits a Paleocene-Eocene transition sequence that is not only expanded but is also close to being stratigraphically complete. The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically <10 cm). Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study. During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100 m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996). This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2). Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996). The CIE at the Paleoceneâ€“Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4. The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009). Therefore, surface water salinity changes in the North Sea Basin provide a sensitive gauge for stratification forced by changes in tectonics and the hydrologic cycle.
