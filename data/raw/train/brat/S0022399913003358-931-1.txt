Tinnitus is the perception of sounds in the head or ears, usually defined as a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound. Tinnitus can be objective or subjective. Objective tinnitus is caused by sounds generated by an internal biological activity. However, subjective tinnitus is much more common and results from abnormal neural activities which are not formed by sounds [1]. Subjective tinnitus is a common and disturbing phenomenon, with a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 20% [2â€“5] in the general population, and an estimated 10 year incidence rate in adults aged over 48 years of 13% [6]. Approximately 5% of the population is severely affected by their tinnitus [7], for example experiencing sleep disorders, concentration difficulties, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.
