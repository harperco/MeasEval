Fig. 8 shows the mean difference between wind speeds measured by the lidar and sonic anemometer against anemometer wind speed. The data was divided into bins of 1 m s−1. The error bars show the standard error of the data in each bin. The mean difference between the two instruments remains fairly constant, with the lidar overestimating the wind speed by between 0 and 0.5 m s−1. At wind speeds greater than 20 m s−1 the lidar appears to be overestimating the wind speed. Further observations would be required to determine whether this is an accurate reflection of the performance of this method at very high wind speeds.
