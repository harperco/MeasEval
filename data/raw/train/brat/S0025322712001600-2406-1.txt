Analysis of the diffraction data was conducted by measuring peak intensity as peak area using Bruker Diffrac Plus EVA-12.0 software. Estimates of mineral composition were made by a reference intensity ratio method based on factors calculated with the Newmod programme as described in Hillier (2003). Illite crystallinity was measured using the full width at half maximum (FHWM) of the 001 basal illite peak and integral breadth (I Breadth) of the same peak (Kübler and Jaboyedoff, 2000). Both measurements are measured as values of ∆2°θ and show identical trends (Alizai et al., 2012). Because our cores are < 9 m long, post-depositional burial diagenesis should not be a significant factor in clay mineral composition. Where clay mineral values are greater than 10% uncertainty is estimated as better than 5% weight at the 95% confidence level (Hillier, 2003). Clay mineral estimates are shown in Table 1.
