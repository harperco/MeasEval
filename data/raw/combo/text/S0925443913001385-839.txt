Mitochondrial protein synthesis. De novo synthesis of mitochondrial proteins was determined in patient (P) and control (C) fibroblasts under conditions that inhibited cytosolic translation [45]. In vivo incorporation of 35S-methionine/cysteine into mitochondrially encoded proteins was visualised by separation of cell lysate (50 μg) through SDS–PAGE, exposure of the dried gel to a PhosphorImage screen, followed by Storm and ImageQuant analysis (upper panel). To the right of the gel are the aligned densitometric profiles of the patient (lower trace) and control (upper trace). The gel was subsequently rehydrated and stained with Coomassie blue to confirm equal loading (lower panel).
