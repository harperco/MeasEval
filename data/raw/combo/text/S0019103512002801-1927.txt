Using equations from Borisov and Mall (2000) and output from the hybrid simulations, we estimate that the flute instability has a linear growth rate of about 0.1–0.2 s−1 just behind Rhea, giving a growth time of 5–10 s, comparable to the time scales inferred particle transport in Rhea’s wake through the observed, narrow channels (Section 5.1). The rate reduces by an order of magnitude 10RRh downstream, and disappears at larger distances, since magnetic field and pressure gradients diminish.
