After adjustment for multiple covariates (age, sex, marital status, education, socioeconomic status, retirement, cognitive impairment, body mass index, alcohol consumption, menopausal status [women], and nonvascular chronic condition), the association between vascular disease and subsequent CES-D depressive symptoms remained in participants with no prevalent or previous depressive episodes, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Table 3). Higher stroke risk score was associated with higher odds of onset of CES-D depressive symptoms before (odds ratio 2.30, 95% CI 1.03â€“5.13), but not after, the age 65. The CVD and CHD risk scores were not associated with subsequent depressive symptoms.
