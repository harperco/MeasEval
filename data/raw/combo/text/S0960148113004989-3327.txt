The averaged power extracted during one cycle increased by 22% from 48.4 MW to 59.0 MW (Fig. 10e). Since the computational domain is symmetric and the simulation time covered one full period, the optimised layout is expected to be symmetric in the x-direction. The numerical solution, shown in Fig. 10b, indeed shows an almost symmetric result. The turbine alignment consists of two distorted ∨ shapes whose open ends face the in/-outflow boundaries. Similar to the previous example, an interpretation of this alignment is to divert the stream towards the corner of the ∨ where turbines can extract large amounts of power. An additional row of turbines can be seen parallel to the bottom of the domain. These turbines are positioned to capture energy from the flow passing along the boundary.
