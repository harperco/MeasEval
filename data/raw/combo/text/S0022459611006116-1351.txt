The synthesis of a pale cream powder of 2 was achieved at 1423 K. Initial experiments had shown that a higher temperature was required for formation of 2 otherwise a small impurity of 1 was always observed. Powder diffraction measurements showed a match to the pattern for the previously reported low temperature phase of Mg2NF (ICDD Card number 25-0516). The reflections could be indexed to a tetragonal unit cell with a=4.1816(4) Å and c=10.0322(6) Å which compares well with the literature values of a=4.186 Å and c=10.042 Å [3]. As for 1, initial Rietveld refinement of 2 was performed against PXD data. The refinement progressed smoothly and gave a good fit to the data using the L-Mg2NF structure as a starting model.
