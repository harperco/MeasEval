To study the effect of the FARS2 mutations on the steady state levels of mt-tRNAPhe, high resolution northern blotting was performed using total RNA extracted from patient myoblasts. The levels of mt-tRNAVal and mt-tRNALeu(UUR) were used as loading controls and the level of mt-tRNAPhe was assessed as a percentage relative to controls. We observed an approximately 54% reduction in the level of mt-tRNAPhe when compared with normal controls (Fig. 3D).
