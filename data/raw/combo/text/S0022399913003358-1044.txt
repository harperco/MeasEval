Self-reported hearing difficulty was the strongest association with tinnitus. Previous research has shown that around 40% of 55â€“74 year olds with hearing difficulties also report tinnitus [36], and the majority of tinnitus patients have some degree of hearing loss [37]. No single theory explaining the cause of tinnitus is universally accepted, but one theory suggests that tinnitus may result from an increase of central gain (to compensate for deprived sensory inputs) which amplifies neural noise in order to maintain neural homeostasis [38]. It is likely that the severity of tinnitus is influenced by a complex interaction involving auditory, psychological and emotional networks [39,40]. It is interesting that neuroticism is a strong association with current tinnitus, albeit not as strong as hearing difficulty. Furthermore, of those who have tinnitus, neuroticism has a stronger effect on the perceived severity than hearing difficulty. One explanation could be that those who are more neurotic may think their tinnitus is indicative of a more serious condition and therefore find the tinnitus more bothersome. The finding that personality traits such as neuroticism can contribute to tinnitus awareness and distress is important when considering treatment approaches because personality traits are generally stable over time [41], although the absolute level of personality traits can change [42]. Thus it is possible that psychological interventions may be beneficial for tinnitus patients although the effects may be gradual [11].
