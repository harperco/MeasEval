The temperature changes with electron energy flux depend on the electric field strength that was set. For a moderate field strength of 80 mV m−1 the temperature is virtually constant when increasing the energy flux from 0.2 to 1.2 mW m−2, while at E = 100 mV m−1 it increases from ∼550 K to 850 K. Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).
