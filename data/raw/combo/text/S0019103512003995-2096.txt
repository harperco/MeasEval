K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman α line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010). Hence the mean temperature in the thermosphere of HD209458b is approximately 8250 K (the M7 model of K10).
