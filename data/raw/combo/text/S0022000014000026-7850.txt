We next introduce the basic modules that are assumed by the model used in [13]. We first give an intuitive description of the required modules. Subsequently, we introduce a novel formal framework for specifying self-stabilizing fault-tolerant modules and specify our basic modules in this framework. Any implementation satisfying this specification can be plugged into the high-level algorithm in order to yield a system guaranteeing the properties proved in [13].
