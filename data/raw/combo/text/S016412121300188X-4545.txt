Table 4 shows the statistics for the five largest clusters of acct. Column 1 gives the cluster number, where 1 is the largest and 5 is the 5th largest cluster measured using the number of vertices. Columns 2 and 3 show the size of the cluster as a percentage of the program's vertices and actual vertex count, as well as the line count. Columns 4 and 5 show the number of files and functions where the cluster is found. The cluster sizes range from 11.4% to 2.4%. These five clusters can be readily identified in the Heat-Map visualization (not shown) of decluvi. The rest of the clusters are very small (less than 2% or 30 vertices) in size and are thus of little interest.
