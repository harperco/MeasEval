Fig. 6 shows the concentrations of minor elements in the solid sorbent, where increasing bed inventory resulted in increasing values observed for Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cd, and Sn. In the case of Cu and Sn, values were obtained that were lower than that of the blank for a bed inventory of 4.5 kg, which then increased to values of 22 and 0.22 ppm respectively for 13 kg. In the case of Gd, Dy and U, small decreases in concentration were found for an increasing inventory, however values are low at <1 ppm and the changes observed are small. The remaining elements (Zr, Le, Ce, Pt, and Nd) recorded an increase in concentration for 6 kg over 4.5 kg, and then a decrease from 6 kg to 13 kg. All minor element flue gas concentrations were <0.1 ppm and therefore considered negligible.
