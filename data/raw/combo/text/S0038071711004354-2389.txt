The partitioning obtained using the two end-member mixing model suggested that the autotrophic flux of 0.18 g CO2 m−2 h−1contributed the larger fraction of RS, 56%, while the heterotrophic component flux of 0.15 g CO2 m−2 h−1accounted for the remaining 44% (Table 3). As for the three end-member model, there was little evidence of large differences in these figures between morning and afternoon.
