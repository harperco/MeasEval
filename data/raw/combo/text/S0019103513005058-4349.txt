To semi-quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the deposition fluxes of salts to temperature, we forced the model temperature profile to higher values by increasing the temperature profile by 35% in 5% increments. Warmer temperatures significantly increase the formation of perchloric acid. Over the range tested, the deposition rate of perchloric acid increases by around six orders of magnitude.
