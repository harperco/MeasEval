Several methods, such as adding a DC-side inductor or using an active rectifier, can be used to reduce the harmonic content of the armature currents and thereby reducing the armature resistive loss. An active rectifier can draw currents with low harmonic content at unity power factor thus minimising the resistive loss for a given voltage and power level. At unity power factor, the armature current is proportional to the phase emf; it then follows from Eqs. (18), (19), (24) and (27) that the armature resistive loss is(30)Pr′=2R3(PgωΛ)2,when ωΛ≠0 and the phase currents are drawn at unity power factor. Core loss can be reduced by reducing thickness of the stator laminations or using stator material with lower hysteresis loss.
