Thermospheric response time: The thermosphere and magnetosphere are coupled together via ion-neutral collisions in the ionosphere; therefore a change in plasma angular velocity would cause a corresponding change in the thermosphere's effective angular velocity. Recent models for the thermospheric response are generally divided in two scenarios: (i) a system where the thermosphere responds promptly, on the order of a few tens of minutes as found by Millward et al. (2005), and (ii) a system where the thermosphere responds on the order of 2 days and, as such, is essentially unresponsive to transient events (Gong, 2005). However, in this study, we do not make a distinction between thermospheric response models. We simply allow the GCM to respond self-consistently to the imposed changes in plasma angular velocity assumed for the transient compressions and expansions, thus allowing a realistic, thermospheric response to these changes.
