The paired-click paradigm followed the protocol of Adler et al. (1993), in which 3 ms binaural clicks were presented in pairs (S1 and S2) with 500 ms inter-stimulus interval and with inter-trial interval jitter between 7 and 11 s, averaging 9 s. Clicks were delivered through earphones placed in each ear canal. The peak intensity of the click was presented 35 dB above each subject's hearing threshold. Presenting 150 click trials, the duration of the task was approximately 25 minutes. As previously noted, the present study examined only S1 activity at 50 and 100 ms.
