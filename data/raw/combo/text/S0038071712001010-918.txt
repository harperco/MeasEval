AM fungal inoculum as a single factor was significant (P < 0.001) with distinct species combinations resulting in different levels of root colonisation. The individual inocula resulted in similar levels of colonisation (9.9%â€“16.2%; LSD = 7.01) irrespective of species, therefore valid comparisons with and between the mixed species could be made. The highest percentage colonisation was observed in the two-species mixture of G. geosporum plus G. mosseae (25.4%), followed by the combination of all three species (23.8%). Percentage colonisation by G. geosporum plus G. mosseae in combination appeared to be additive relative to that observed by the species individually (16.2%, G. geosporum; 9.9% G. mosseae). Colonisation was markedly reduced when G. mosseae and G. intraradices were paired (7.5%), particularly compared to the performance of G. intraradices individually (14.2%). Arbuscules followed a similar pattern to hyphal colonisation, with the G. geosporum and G. mosseae combination containing the most arbuscules (data not shown). No mycorrhizal colonisation was observed in the uninoculated plant roots.
