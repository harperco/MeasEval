Although computer-aided diagnosis of hearing loss is not needed, our algorithm can potentially advance the study of congenital hearing loss mechanism by identifying discriminative brain regions as disease biomarkers for hearing impairment at various levels in the auditory system. Inspecting the most important features that differentiate children born with hearing impairment from children with normal hearing in this study, we see some features that are in line with hypotheses about under stimulation of auditory function in HI infants; while other observations already begin to add to our knowledge of how congenital deafness affects brain development and function. For example, features B, F, H, and I include known components of the auditory language network which our group and others have previously shown to be engaged by the narrative comprehension task (Karunanayaka et al., 2007; Schmithorst et al., 2006). These features include (B) the planum temporale and primary auditory cortex in the left hemisphere (including Wernicke's area, the classical language recognition module), as well as the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus at the temporal parietal junction of the (F) left and (H, I) right hemispheres, known auditory and visual language association regions. Although all participants were bilaterally severely to profoundly hearing impaired, we observe left dominant auditory/language related activity present in components A, B, and F. In addition, components H and I contain right hemisphere auditory/language activity. Functional features such as these are not unexpected in terms of regions of differential cortical activation between HI and NH children listening to natural language as an auditory stimulus and it is reassuring to see these regions highlighted by our algorithm as potential biomarkers corresponding to hearing impairment. Similarly, there is evidence of differential activation in subcortical features corresponding to the auditory brainstem pathways. Features A, D, and J include elements of the reticular auditory pathway of the brainstem which has been identified by electrophysiological studies to have a key role in auditory perception of location of sounds as well as the ability to filter a source of sound in background noise. Roughly these features appear to encompass key elements of the auditory pathway at the level of the pons (D) including the cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, lateral lemniscus and superior olive on the right, (A) inferior colliculus, medial geniculate on the left and (J) thalamus bilaterally (Kretschmann and Weinrich, 1998). Although the resolution of the fMRI scans (4 × 4 × 5 mm) is not sufficient to resolve these structures individually, differences in activation in these regions, as indicated by reference to the higher resolution anatomical images, suggest that brain stem auditory nuclei may be involved.
