The significant change in behaviour for the mutual topology at time 1800 s occurs when the turbine that experiences the lowest wind speed (turbine 4) stops delivering power and all turbine power is used to overcome the generator core loss. The mutual topology is unable to extract power from turbine 4 since the higher rotational velocity causes both a reduced CP (57% of the separate topology at 1800 s) and an increased core loss. The separate topology is able to extract power from turbine 4 until 2700 s due to the lower rotational velocity.
