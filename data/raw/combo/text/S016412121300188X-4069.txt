As an example, the open source calculator bc contains 9438 lines of code represented by 7538 SDG vertices. The B-MSG for bc, shown in Fig. 3a, contains a large plateau that spans almost 70% of the MSG. Under the assumption that same slice size implies the same slice, this indicates a large same-slice cluster. However, “zooming” in reveals that the cluster is actually composed of several smaller clusters made from slices of very similar size. The tolerance implicit in the visual resolution used to plot the MSG obscures this detail.
