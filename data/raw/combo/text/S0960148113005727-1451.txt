Fig. 9a highlights these first two reasons as a gradual downwards slope in the bulk of weather-corrected load factor observations, and isolated periods of very low output due to downtime which are concentrated towards higher ages. Fig. 3a shows an example of the third: Blyth Harbour stands out at the lower-right of the chart as its load factor declined from 12% to just 2% between the ages of 12 and 17. By the end of its life only one of the nine turbines was generating, giving it the worst degradation rate of the farms we observed.
