The ternary magnesium nitride fluorides were prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of synthesised Mg3N2 with anhydrous MgF2 (Aldrich, 99.9%). All manipulations were carried out under inert nitrogen or argon atmospheres. The appropriate 1:3 and 1:1 stoichiometric molar ratios were used in the synthesis of Mg3NF3 (1) and Mg2NF (2) respectively, as shown below:(1)Mg3N2+3MgF2→2Mg3NF3(2)Mg3N2+MgF2→2Mg2NF
