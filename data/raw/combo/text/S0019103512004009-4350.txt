The substellar tide is included in the C3 model. We included it mainly to compare our results with previous models (Garcia Munoz, 2007; Penz et al., 2008; Murray-Clay et al., 2009). The substellar tide is not a particularly good representation of the stellar tide in a globally averaged sense. In reality, including tides in the models is much more complicated than simply considering the substellar tide (e.g., Trammell et al., 2011). Compared to the C1 model, the maximum temperature in the C3 model is cooler by ∼1000 K and at high altitudes the C3 model is cooler by 1000–2000 K. The velocity is faster and hence adiabatic cooling is also more efficient. The substellar tide drives supersonic escape (see also, Penz et al., 2008) and the sonic point in the C3 model is at a much lower altitude than in the C1 model (see Section 3.1.3). However, it is not clear how the sonic point behaves as a function of latitude and longitude. Given that the tide is also likely to induce horizontal flows, it cannot be included accurately in 1D models.
