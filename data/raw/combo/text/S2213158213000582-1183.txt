Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a now large number of studies show smaller 100 ms auditory amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) than healthy controls (HC). In a review of studies examining N1 and M100 in schizophrenia, Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that 100 ms auditory abnormalities are most commonly observed in studies using interstimulus intervals greater than 1 s and that an increase in N1 amplitude by allocation of attention is often lacking in individuals with SZ. Several large-sample studies provide examples. Examining N1 activity in the standard paired-click paradigm, Turetsky et al. (2008) observed a small first and a normal second N1 click response in SZ (N = 142) relative to HC (N = 221). Reduced N1 was also observed in the unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ without co-morbid psychiatric or substance use conditions, and N1 amplitude was observed to be a heritable measure and a better endophenotype than N1 gating. In another recent large-N study, Smith et al. (2010) used simultaneous EEG and MEG to examine 100 ms auditory processes in individuals with SZ (N = 79) and HC (N = 73) during a paired-click task. Patients had larger N1 Cz and left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) M100 ratio scores (second-click/first-click), with EEG and MEG ratio score group differences due to a smaller first click (S1) response in patients, suggesting a deficit in encoding auditory information rather than a deficit in filtering redundant information.
