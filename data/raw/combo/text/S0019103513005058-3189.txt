Salts are relevant to the habitability of Mars. First, perchlorate reduction is a metabolism used by some terrestrial bacteria in anaerobic conditions (Coates and Achenbach, 2004). If such organisms exist (or did exist) on Mars, then they could gain energy by reducing perchlorate and oxidizing an electron donor such as organic carbon or ferrous iron. This would require organic molecules to be present on Mars. Indigenous organic molecules have yet to be confirmed on Mars; however the presence of perchlorate itself may have inhibited the detection of organics on Mars in pyrolysis experiments (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010). Second, perchlorate salts are highly deliquescent and significantly lower the freezing point of liquid water (Gough et al., 2011). The eutectic point of Mg(ClO4)2 is −57 °C (Stillman and Grimm, 2011), while that of Ca(ClO4)2 is −75 °C (Pestova et al., 2005). Given typical soil salt concentrations, small amounts of water (∼0.02 g H2O per g soil) would permit a water activity sufficient for terrestrial life to be viable (Kounaves et al., 2010b). Third, if all organisms require fixed nitrogen in proteins and nucleic acids, as they do on Earth, then the discovery of nitrogen oxyanions on Mars would be significant as well.
