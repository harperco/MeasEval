Thermodynamic modelling using MTDATA software was undertaken in addition to pilot scale tests, in a bid to improve understanding of the likely compounds and associated phase formation of elements under carbonation and calcination conditions. Modelling was undertaken for 4 major elements (C, Ca, O, and H) and up to 9 minor elements (Ba, Cd, Cr, K, Mg, Ni, Sr, Ti, and Zn) based on those which are considered to be most volatile, have the greatest negative impact on the environment and health, and which were present in the highest quantities in the limestone as identified by ICP-MS analysis as outlined in Table 2, in order to investigate partitioning behaviour under pilot scale CO2 capture conditions. The multiphase module of MTDATA was used in the modelling, combined with the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) database, in order to predict compound/phase formation for the complete temperature range, from temperatures of 600 째C, up to 750 째C for carbonation and 1000 째C for calcination, in steps of 20 째C, and at atmospheric pressure. Molar quantities, based on ICP-MS analysis of the limestone, for each of the elements being investigated were entered into the model.
