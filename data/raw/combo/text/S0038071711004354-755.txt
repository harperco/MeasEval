Time series of the dual-chamber test using a grassland mesocosm maintained under glasshouse conditions. (a) The δ13C–CO2 in the bottom-chamber. The initial δ13C (approximately −14‰) represents the δ13C of ambient CO2 inside the glasshouse. (b) CO2 concentration measured in the bottom (Cb), in the top (Ct), and reference chamber (Cr). (c) Soil surface flux measured by the dual-chamber (RS), and CO2 diffusion coefficient across the dual-chamber (Dc). Data are shown from the time of deployment of the dual-chamber on the soil surface to the time when the δ13C value of the CO2 stabilised after approximately 2.5 h at −28.5 ± 0.33‰ (mean ± SD, n = 60).
