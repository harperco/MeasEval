We investigated the effect of transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure on the Mâ€“I coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling rates and aurora of the Jovian system. We considered two scenarios: (i) a transient compression event and (ii) a transient expansion event. Both of these were imposed over a time scale of 3 h. A transient compression event consists of an initially expanded, steady-state magnetospheric configuration. The model Jovian magnetosphere then encounters a shock in the solar wind, which compresses the system. As the conceptual shock propagates past the magnetosphere, a rarefaction region follows and the magnetosphere subsequently expands back to its initial state. The opposite occurs for our expansion event.
