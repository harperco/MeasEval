Using the optimized operating conditions we demonstrate serial passaging and expansion of two integration-free hiPSC lines in completely defined xeno-free media in 100-ml bioreactors. The cells exhibited homogeneous aggregate formation, steady expansion in their pluripotent state, and normal karyotype after ~ 20 passages. Note that one experiment of extended expansion of TNC1 cells in spinner flask (p30 + 6 + 21) showed abnormal karyotype (47, XXY). However, there is no evidence that it should be attributed to the suspension culture. In general, recently improved iPSC culture conditions reduce selective pressure for the growth of mutated cells that acquire growth advantages. Although karyotypically abnormal cells were found occasionally after long-term cultures under both adherent and suspension conditions, the frequency is low (5% of tested batches of hiPSCs and hESCs). The standard karyotyping or other genotyping methods like what we performed here will remain necessary to manage this inherent issue of long-term cell cultures.
