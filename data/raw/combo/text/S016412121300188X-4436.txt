To assess if a program includes a large coherent cluster, requires making a judgement concerning what threshold constitutes large. Following prior empirical work (Binkley and Harman, 2005; Harman et al., 2009; Islam et al., 2010a,b), a threshold of 10% is used. In other words, a program is said to contain a large coherent cluster if 10% of the program's SDG vertices produce the same backward slice as well as the same forward slice.
