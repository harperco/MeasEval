The fate of trace elements was investigated in a 90 kW oxy-combustion pilot plant fed with coal and limestone [7]. It was shown that 82% of elemental Hg was emitted in the exhaust gas, as was 81% of Cl. It was further suggested that the relatively low temperatures, and high Ca content in the system from limestone use promoted condensation and sorption of sulphate, fluoride and chloride species.
