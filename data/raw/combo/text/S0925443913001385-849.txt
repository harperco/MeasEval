Analysis of mitochondrial transcripts and of MRPs immunoprecipitating with MRPL12. A. Steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts from patient (P) and control (C) fibroblasts were analyzed by Northern blot. Signals were normalized against 18S cytosolic rRNA. Three different amounts (2, 5 and 10 μg) of total RNAs were loaded. B. MRPL12 was immunoprecipitated from mitochondrial lysates (835 μg) prepared from patient (P) and control (C) fibroblasts. Recovered MRPL12 and co-immunoprecipitating MRPs were analyzed by western blot (antibodies as previously described).
