The STIM GCM calculates the transport by winds and molecular and turbulent diffusion of key neutral species (H, H2, He, CH4, H2O), following the procedures outlined by Müller-Wodarg et al. (2006). The global spherical grid has flexible resolution. For simulations in this study we assumed spacing in latitude and longitude of 2° and 10°, respectively, and a vertical resolution of 0.4 scale heights. Our time integration step was 5 s and we ran the code for 500 Saturn rotations to reach steady state.
