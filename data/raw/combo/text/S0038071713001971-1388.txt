A conceptual picture on what was a healthy or a diseased soil could be perceived by looking at the responses of majority of fungal community members to soil variables. Majority (55%) of OTUs in healthy soils were stimulated (encouraged) by a certain set of soil variables but the majorities (63%) in diseased soils were inhibited (discouraged) (Table 1). For a complex natural community, it is impossible that every environmental element encourages every community member: majority makes senses. With this view, a healthy soil was likely a soil with variables that encouraged majority of fungal community, whereas a diseased soil was a soil with variables that discouraged majorities. Any society that encourages majority of its members will be more likely to become a vigorous and successful society.
