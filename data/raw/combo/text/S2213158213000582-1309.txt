MEG raw signals were first processed with Signal Space Separation (SSS; Taulu et al., 2004) using Maxfilter (Elekta MaxfilterTM; Elekta Oy). SSS separates neuronal magnetic signals arising from inside the MEG sensor array from external magnetic signals arising from the surrounding environment to effectively reduce environmental noise and artifacts. After SSS, S1 epochs 500 ms pre-stimulus to 500 ms post-stimulus were averaged. Trials containing eye-blinks and large eye-movements were excluded. On average, 103 trials were obtained for each subject, and there were no group differences in number of accepted trials (t(39) = 0.30, p = 0.77).
