All analyses were carried out at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory. C and N analyses (from which we present weight % C/N) were performed on 225 samples by combustion in a Costech ECS4010 Elemental Analyser (EA) calibrated against an acetanilide standard (Table S3). C/N atomic ratios were calculated by multiplying by 1.167. Replicate analysis of well-mixed samples indicated a precision of ±<0.1. Carbon isotope analysis was carried out on 289 bulk rock samples (Table S4) after removing migrated hydrocarbons (Stephenson et al., 2005). The hydrocarbons were removed by crushing the rock fragments using a ball mill, and the soluble organic matter from all rock samples was extracted using a Soxhlet extractor. The samples were refluxed for 24 h in an azeotropic mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (93:7, v/v). All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use. Any remaining solvent was then removed by evaporation and the dried sediments were transferred to vials. Any calcites (shelly fragments) were removed by placing the samples in 5% HCl overnight before rinsing and drying down. Carbon isotope analysis was also carried out on palynology residues of the >250 μm size fractions dominated by AOM. 13C/12C analyses were performed on 35 samples by combustion in a Costech Elemental Analyser (EA) online to a VG TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer, with δ13C values calculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standards calibrated against NBS-18, NBS-19, and NBS-22. Replicate 13C/12C analyses were carried out on the section, and the mean standard deviation on the replicate analyses is 0.4‰.
