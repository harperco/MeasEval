The present study shows that STG and non-STG areas (e.g., frontal regions) are involved in early auditory encoding. Replicating findings from our prior study that used single dipole source localization to examine STG activity (Smith et al., 2010) and now examining a new sample using a different MEG system and applying distributed source localization methods, reduced S1 STG activity was observed in SZ, again supporting impaired encoding of auditory information. Whereas in Smith et al. we observed left 50 ms and bilateral 100 ms STG group differences, group differences were observed bilaterally at both 50 and 100 ms in this new sample.
