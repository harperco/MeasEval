Further work that could be conducted, as a result of these findings, would be to firstly consider a stacking approach to classification through the combination of multiple techniques. Such an approach would allow a meta-learner to pick the best model to classify an observation. Secondly, another interesting extension to the research would be to apply these techniques on much larger data sets which display a wider variety of class distributions. It would also be of interest to look into the effect of not only the percentage class distribution but also the effect of the actual number of observations in a data set.
