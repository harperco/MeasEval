In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).
