This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committees of the University of California, San Francisco, and written informed consent was obtained in all cases. The patient with the PGRN S116X mutation followed the classic clinical progression for FTD and developed parkinsonism, as do all FTD patients with PGRN mutations, but he did not show typical features of PD dementia. The patient with sporadic FTD also showed parkinsonism. Skin biopsies were collected, cut into small pieces, and placed on culture dishes to allow the fibroblasts to expand. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1X nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml). iPSCs were generated as described previously (Takahashi et al., 2007). Please see Supplemental Information for more details.
