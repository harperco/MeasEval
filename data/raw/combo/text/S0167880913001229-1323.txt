In Nicaragua no significant differences in changes of SOC stock between the organic and conventional treatments were detected for any soil depth. Nevertheless, the trends were generally similar to Costa Rica, with a greater increase of SOC stock at 0–10 cm depth in the organic compared with the conventional treatment and in the 20–40 cm depth a similar decrease in SOC stock between them (Fig. 4). In Nicaragua, like Costa Rica, there was a positive correlation between the mass of organic fertiliser inputs and changes in 0–10 cm depth SOC (r2 = 0.07, p < 0.05).
