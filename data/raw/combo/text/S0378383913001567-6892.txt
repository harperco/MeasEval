The channel is 40 m wide and 90 m long with two symmetrical wall constrictions from both sides with angle β = 5° to the x-direction, starting from x = 10 m. The simulations were run on two different grids: a 121 × 53 regular curvilinear grid, with nearly square-shaped calculation cells and a highly distorted grid obtained by deforming the above-mentioned 121 × 53 regular grid. The initial and inflow conditions are the water depth h = 1 m and the Froude number Fr = 2.5.
