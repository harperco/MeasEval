The numerical model described in Section 2 is used to simulate the large-scale laboratory experiments presented in Steenhauer et al. (2011a). Fig. 5 illustrates the set-up in a Cartesian system with x and z coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively, and with the origin at the initial shoreline position. The experiments involved two beach materials with nominal sediment diameters of 1.5 mm and 8.5 mm. The dam-break set-up is simulated through a water reservoir with initial water depth in the reservoir 600 mm for experimental series R60PER015 of the 1.5 mm beach and experimental series R60PER085 of the 8.5 mm beach. An initial water level of 62 mm in front of the beach and a corresponding groundwater level of 62 mm within the beach were used in both cases. The initial shoreline position is defined through the initial water depth in front of the reservoir. The slope of the beach was 1:10. A detailed description of the experimental set-up, surface and subsurface measurements and results are presented in Steenhauer et al. (2011a).
