The cumulative lifetime output of a 100 MW wind farm with a 28.5% load factor would be 4.99 TWh over 20 years. If this farm suffers a linear annual deterioration of −0.41 points after the first year, its lifetime output reduces to 4.37 TWh, a fall of 12.5%. This will increase the cost of electricity from wind generators, as less electricity is produced to recover the costs of construction. The economic value of the lost output is relatively low as it mostly occurs in the far future. With a discount rate of 10%, degradation increases the levelised cost of electricity by 9%, from approximately £90 [4,5] to £98 per MWh. This impact becomes greater if the economic lifetime increases or the discount rate decreases.
