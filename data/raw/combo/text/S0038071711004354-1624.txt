In order to test the operation of the dual-chambers, measurements were made in a glasshouse using a mesocosm of 150 cm long, 100 cm wide, filled with a soil depth of 15 cm. The mesocosm had been sown with Lolium perenne (perennial rye-grass) the previous year and kept in a glasshouse under optimal growing conditions for approximately four months. Approximately 15 min before the beginning of the experiment, the aboveground vegetation was removed under the dual-chamber, as well as the reference chamber which was deployed at 30 cm distance from the dual-chamber. The CRDS continuous measurements of δ13C–CO2, and CO2 concentration (Cb) from the bottom-chamber, started before deploying the dual-chamber on the ground.
