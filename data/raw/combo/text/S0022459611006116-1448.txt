SQUID magnetometry measurements revealed that both samples 1 and 2 exhibit weak temperature independent paramagnetic behaviour (typically χM∼5×10−4 emu mol−1) between 5 and 300 K. This behaviour is commensurate with other alkaline earth nitride halides and suggests either weakly paramagnetic materials or intrinsically diamagnetic materials with very small levels of alkaline earth metal impurities (below the detection limit of PXD and PND) [15,16]. (A plot of χM vs. T for 1 and 2 is available as Supplementary information.)
