Flybys E12 and E13 (middle and right panels of Fig. 2) were nearly identical in terms of the flyby geometry, directly above the north pole of the moon with a minimum distance of only 50 km. Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region. This may be coincidence and has to be checked during the upcoming encounters for consistency.
