The degradation of P700 is for most devices not so significant, most of the devices have not more than 0.65%/a degradation. The only exceptions are a-Si-1 and CIGS-1. a-Si-1 was a new device at the beginning of the study, so the degradation figure includes the initial Staeblerâ€“Wronski degradation despite any precondition being carried out. This means that the absolute degradation rate might be marginally affected by the initial SWE and a slightly lower rate might be observed over a longer period. The degradation of the devices is, however, higher than the rest as apparent from Fig. 10. It should be noted, however, that the PR degradation should be similarly affected but is even higher than the P700 degradation demonstrating the need for long-term energy yield estimation.
