On first postoperative exam (days 3â€“5), a white retinal opacity overlying the hRPE implant was seen on fundus photography, along with occasional triamcinolone crystals trapped around the retinotomy site. The whitish opacity was subsequently lost in both hRPE implant types, with all remaining follow-up exams (beyond 1 week postoperation [post-OP]) showing a steep edge around the implant periphery (Figure 2A for fetal and 2C for adult; Movies S3 and S4).
