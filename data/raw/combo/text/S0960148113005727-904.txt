This could have significant policy implications for the desirability of investing in wind power, as argued in a recent report by Hughes for the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF) [1]. That report suggested that the load factors of wind farms in the UK have declined by 5â€“13% per year, normalising for month-by-month variations in wind speeds. These findings could represent a significant hurdle for the wind industry, but they require replication.
