To increase reflectance of the HSQ film and to avoid light transmission and reflection from the metal substrate, we sputter coated cured HSQ samples with a thin film of gold/palladium (80/20) alloy. We used the Balzers SCD 004 sputter coater, operated with 0.06â€“0.07 mBar pressure of Argon. Samples have been processed for 240 s at 30 mA current. A silicon wafer is always included to examine the effect of sputtering on roughness.
