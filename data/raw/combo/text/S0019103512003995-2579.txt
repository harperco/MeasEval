Fig. 4 shows the density profiles of H, H+, O, and O+ from the C2 model, and the density profile of H from the M7b model. The difference between the transit depths based on the empirical and hydrodynamic models arises because the C2 model has large temperature gradients (Paper I) and a gradual H/H+ transition rather than a sharp cutoff. The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown). This implies that the correspondence of the mean temperature of the empirical model and the pressure averaged temperature of the hydrodynamic model is relatively good but not exact.
