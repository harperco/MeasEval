Samples of ternary nitride fluorides, Mg3NF3 and Mg2NF have been prepared by solid state reaction of Mg3N2 and MgF2 at 1323â€“1423 K and investigated by powder X-ray and powder neutron diffraction techniques. Mg3NF3 is cubic (space group: Pm3m) and has a structure related to rock-salt MgO, but with one cation site vacant. Mg2NF is tetragonal (space group: I41/amd) and has an anti-LiFeO2 related structure. Both compounds are essentially ionic and form structures in which nitride and fluoride anions are crystallographically ordered. The nitride fluorides show temperature independent paramagnetic behaviour between 5 and 300 K.
