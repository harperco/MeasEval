By integrating seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations, we have estimated the impact of the reservoir temperature on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin. We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 째C and the other at 38 째C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 째C and 38 째C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).
