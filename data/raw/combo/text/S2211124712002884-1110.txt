iPSC colonies were detached with accutase (Millipore) and grown as embryoid bodies (EBs) in suspension for 5–6 days in iPSC medium without basic fibroblast growth factor. EBs were allowed to attach and form rosettes. Ten-day-old rosettes were collected and grown in suspension as neurospheres. Neurospheres were dissociated after 3–4 weeks, and the cells were plated on glass coverslips (BD Biosciences) or plates coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) and laminin (10 μg/m). Neurons were used after 2-4 weeks in culture.
