Correspondence analysis (first two axes) for: (a) spores and pollen species (total counts per gram, axis 1=39% of total variance, axis 2=17% of total variance) and (b) dinoflagellate cysts (total counts per gram, axis 1=31% of total variance, axis 2=11% of total variance), in core 22/10a-4. Symbols indicate depths for each pollen assemblage (PA) and dinoflagellate cyst assemblage (DA), and their correspondingly most associated palynomorph species. Marked depths (red) indicate the samples with pre-CIE peaks in Apectodinium and Î´13CTOC. Samples at 2619.60 m and 2614.71 m (see Fig. 4) plot close to post-CIE onset assemblages PA3 and PA4, and either represent ephemeral episodes of marine and vegetation changes to post-CIE onset type conditions, or possible misplaced samples during drilling operations core handling. Analysis carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
