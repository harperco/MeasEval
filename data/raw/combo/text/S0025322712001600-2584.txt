Clay mineralogy is known to be related to provenance in dust samples within the Arabian Sea. In order to assess whether clay mineralogy relates to provenance in this setting we compared the smectite/(chlorite + illite), smectite/kaolinite and kaolinite/illite with the neodymium isotope characteristics of the sediments because this isotope system is widely accepted as a reliable provenance proxy that is not affected significantly by chemical weathering (Goldstein et al., 1984) (Fig. 10). We exploit bulk neodymium isotope (as expressed by εNd) data from these same cores published by Limmer et al. (2012) and from the coast at Keti Bandar, where sedimentation is believed to track sediment delivery at the river mouth (Clift et al., 2008). Neodymium isotopes are known to be sensitive to source changes in the Indus basin (Clift et al., 2002). In both offshore cores less negative εNd (i.e., less continental, less Himalayan) is often, but not always, associated with higher smectite/(chlorite + illite) ratios. However, more negative εNd values are associated with a range of smectite/(chlorite + illite) ratios (Fig. 10A) and the highest smectite/(chlorite + illite) values are never associated with the least negative εNd values. The kaolinite/illite ratio (Fig. 10B) is associated with a range of εNd values, both onshore and offshore. Overall there is no correlation between clay mineralogy and εNd.
