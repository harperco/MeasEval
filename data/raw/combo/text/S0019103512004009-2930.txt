The differences between previous models arise from different assumptions regarding heating rates and boundary conditions. In addition to modeling the density profiles of the detected heavy species, we have improved these aspects of the calculations in our work. For instance, the lower boundary conditions are constrained by results from a detailed photochemical model of the lower atmosphere (Lavvas et al., in preparation). With regard to the upper boundary conditions, we demonstrate that for HD209458b the extrapolated ‘outflow’ boundary conditions (e.g., Tian et al., 2005) are consistent with recent results from kinetic theory (Volkov et al., 2011a,b) as long as the upper boundary is at a sufficiently high altitude – although uncertainties regarding the interaction of the atmosphere with the stellar wind may limit the validity of both boundary conditions. We highlight the effect of heating efficiency and stellar flux on the density and temperature profiles, and constrain the likely heating rates by using photoelectron heating efficiencies based on the results of Cecchi-Pestellini et al. (2009) and our own estimates (Section 3.1). As a result we provide a robust qualitative description of the density profiles, and constrain the mean temperature and velocity profile in the thermosphere. A second paper by Koskinen et al. (2012) (Paper II) compares our results directly with the observations.
