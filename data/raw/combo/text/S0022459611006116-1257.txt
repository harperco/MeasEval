An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2. A fitted profile plot for the PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 1. (Additional refinement fits and a table of anisotropic thermal displacement parameters can be found in the Supplementary information.)
