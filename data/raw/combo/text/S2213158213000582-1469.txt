A limitation of the present study is that most subjects were chronic patients and all patients were on medication. As such, it is not possible to determine whether the observed abnormalities are observed only in chronic patients or whether group differences were due to medication. Several studies, however, show that 100 ms abnormalities in schizophrenia are present at first onset as well as in first-degree relatives (Turetsky et al., 2008), suggesting that auditory abnormalities in SZ are not due to medication. In addition, in a review of 100 ms auditory studies Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that medication did not seem to account for group differences in N100 activity.
