A few previous studies have examined the longitudinal association between overall vascular risk and later-life depression using other indicators of vascular risk status. In the Health, Aging and Body Composition study of adults aged 70 or higher, a score combining selected vascular risk factors (body mass index, metabolic syndrome, smoking, and ankle arm index) and vascular diseases predicted higher 2-year incidence of elevated depressive symptoms (7). However, the extent to which this association was attributable to vascular risk factors alone is difficult to assess in such a study design. In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression. This null finding was evident irrespective of whether assessment of depression was based on CES-D or a clinical diagnosis obtained from a psychiatric interview (11). Similarly, in the Leiden 85+ prospective cohort study, ratings of generalized atherosclerosis were not associated with depressive symptoms (43).
