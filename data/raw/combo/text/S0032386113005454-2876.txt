Shear-band yielding has previously been reported for the present epoxy-polymer formulation when particle modified [33], and was observed during the present plane–strain compression tests. The DN-4PB tests of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers were performed to investigate the process further. After fracture at 20 °C, the plastic zone at the tip of the sub-critically loaded crack was sectioned and observed using transmission optical microscopy. This showed that a large feather-like deformation zone was formed, see Fig. 16. This feather-like zone comprises highly plastically dilated cavities and localised shear-bands [12,48]. Transmission optical micrographs of the subsurface damage zone of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers tested at different temperatures revealed that the size of the subsurface damage zone decreased as the test temperature decreased, see Fig. 17. This reduction in the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip is due to the increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer at low temperatures.
