A QCM-D instrument, which is a highly sensitive balance based on the measurement of changes in the resonance frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator, was used to study the film formation and complexation processes. The instrument used was a Q-sense E4 microbalance (Q-sense, Gothenburg). The temperature of the measuring cell was controlled at 25 ± 0.02 °C, and the resonant frequency of the oscillator (f) and the energy dissipation value (D) were recorded simultaneously as a function of time. The baseline was determined using the buffer solution without protein.
