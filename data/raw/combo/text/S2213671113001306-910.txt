(D–H) Adult hRPE stained for SC121 (red). (D) Adult hRPE stained for MCT1 (green). (E) Human adult RPE stained for ezrin (green). hRPEs transplanted into rabbit SRS show absence of expression of ki67 (F), phosphohistone H3 (G), and caspase-3 (H). Polarized fetal and adult hRPE cells were found in TEM (I and J). Nuclei with regular chromatin were found in the basal compartment, a basal lamina ([I], large black arrowhead) had formed between the xenograft and PET carrier (black asterisks). Melanosomes (M) in multiple stages, some microvilli abutting to the atrophic neural retina (NR), and junctional structures with desmosomes (small black arrowhead) and tight junctions (red arrowhead) were discerned apically. Mitochondria (MC) were seen in the basolateral part of the cell. Detachment from cell carrier (asterisk) in (J) is a histologic processing artifact. Left images in (I) and (J) taken at 10,500× magnification; right micrographs are rectangular zone in left at 25,000×; scale bars represent 2 μm/inset 0.2 μm distance in (I) and (J).
