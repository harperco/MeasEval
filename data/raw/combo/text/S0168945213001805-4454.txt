RuBisCO evolved before the development of photosynthesis, under CO2 conditions that were much higher than current levels [87]. Hence, many plants flourish at higher CO2 concentrations [88] and warmer temperatures, so they might be expected to thrive in the future higher CO2 environment that has been predicted with continuing climate change. An eight-year study of a deciduous forest confirmed that carbon-enrichment increased net photosynthesis by 42–48% relative to controls [89]. Similarly, free-air enrichment by supplementary CO2 in field plots increased biomass yield by 15–27% in three poplar genotypes (P. alba, P. nigra, and Populus × euramericana) [90].
