Differences between the analytic sample and the excluded participants were generally small (Table S1 in Supplement 1). Compared with those included, participants excluded from the analyses were more likely to be women, nonwhite, and current smokers, although other characteristics were similar in the two groups. Across the 5-year data cycles, 12.1% of participants without GHQ symptoms developed such symptoms, 4.6% of those without CES-D depressive symptoms had such symptoms at follow-up, and 2.1% of those not on antidepressant treatment started such medication. Of the cases of GHQ symptoms, 5.4% used antidepressant medication, the corresponding proportion being 9.2% for those with CES-D depressive symptoms. Of participants with GHQ symptoms, 47.4% also had CES-D depressive symptoms (Pearson correlation at phase 7 r = .64, p < .001). Conversely, among participants with CES-D depressive symptoms, 59.9% also had GHQ symptoms.
