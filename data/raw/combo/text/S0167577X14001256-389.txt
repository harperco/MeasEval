One-dimensional composition profiles of Fe, Cr, Ni, Mo, Mn, Ti, Nb, C, Si, and P across SD 1 and SD 2 are shown in (a) and (d), respectively, and (b) and (e) show the same at higher magnification (12Ã—). These elemental compositions were obtained along the arrow of 4 nm width shown in the insets in (c) and (f).
