Out of the total 689 events of electron precipitation signatures, 85 were observed with a concurrent acceleration of heavy-ions. This accounts for 12% of precipitation signatures occurring on ∼5% of MEX orbits. Only 37 events of electron precipitation signatures were observed with a peripheral acceleration of heavy-ions. This makes the peripheral acceleration of heavy-ions less common occurring on just 5% of precipitation signatures and on ∼2% of MEX orbits. Therefore, it is quite rare to observe accelerated beams of heavy-ions during signatures of electron precipitation at Mars.
