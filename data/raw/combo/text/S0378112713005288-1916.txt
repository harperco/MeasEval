Regeneration density against distance from seed source is plotted in Fig. 2. In general, birch showed a broad shoulder of dense regeneration close to source, followed by a very rapid decline and then a long tail consisting of a slow decline. Linear regression found a logarithmic decline in birch density with increased distance to seed source (see Fig. 2). No significant correlation between distance from seed source (for distances up to 100 m from the source) and regeneration density was seen for animal-dispersed species (oak and rowan). However, the regeneration of both rowan and oak were still strongly clumped (R = 0.23 and 0.28 respectively, both p < 0.0001).
