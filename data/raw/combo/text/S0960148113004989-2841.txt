For the following tests, the analytical solution consists of sinusoidal functions for both the velocity and the free-surface displacement:(13)uexact(x,y,t)=(η0gH−1cos(kx−gHkt)0),ηexact(x,y,t)=η0cos(kx−gHkt),with k = π/640 m−1, η0 = 2 m, H = 50 m, ν = 3 m2 s−1, ct = 0, cb = 0.0025, g = 9.81 m s−2 and a final time of T=π/(gHk)≈28.9s which corresponds to half a wave cycle. The computational domain Ω is defined to be a rectangle of size 640 m × 320 m. Following the method of manufactured solutions, the functions (13) are substituted into the shallow water equations (3) and the non-zero remainders are added as source terms. This ensures that (13) is a solution of this modified system.
