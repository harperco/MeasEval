Improved photosynthesis increases sucrose production but this must be coupled with increased sucrose utilization, storage, or transport to sink tissues to avoid negative feedback regulation [102]. Increased downstream utilization of photosynthetic products has been shown to increase biomass yield [103]. Cellulose and hemicellulose account for âˆ¼70% of wood [104] so over-expression of genes that promote cellulose production should have a significant impact on timber production.
