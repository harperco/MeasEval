The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39â€“41].
