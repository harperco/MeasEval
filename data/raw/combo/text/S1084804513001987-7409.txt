In this section, we propose a strategy to further reduce the distortion area, which is called two-dimensional scaling. Two-dimensional scaling works with any quantization method, such as uniform scaling or logarithmic scaling. We then calculate the upper bound of the distortion area produced by two-dimensional scaling. Finally, we consider both quantization schemes, namely, uniform scaling and logarithmic scaling, and compare the error of two-dimensional scaling with that of the existing quantization-based algorithms.
