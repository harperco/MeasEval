(a) The C II 1334.5 Å line of HD209458 (solid line, Linsky et al., 2010) fitted with a Voigt profile (see Table 1) and adjusted for absorption by the ISM (dotted line). We assumed that the column density of ground state C+ in the ISM is 2.23 × 1019 m−2. The relative velocity of the ISM with respect to Earth is −6.6 km s−1 and the effective thermal velocity along the LOS to the star is 12.3 km s−1 (Wood et al., 2005). (b) The C II 1335.7 Å line of HD209458 fitted with a Voigt profile. Absorption by the ISM was assumed to be negligible. The model profiles were convolved to a spectral resolution of R = 17,500.
