Fig. 9 shows that increasing SO2 concentration has some effect on major element concentration in solids. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Br, Sr, Y, Ba and Pb appear to decrease as SO2 concentration increases. However, there appears to be little difference between concentrations for 1000 and 2000 ppm, the greatest change in concentration being from 0 to 1000 ppm SO2. The trend in the batch experiments whereby concentrations of elements at 1000 ppm were generally lower than at 0 and 2000 ppm, is also seen for some elements in the looping cycle test including Cr, Mn and Fe, but not to the same extent as was seen in the batch tests. Ti shows the same trend for these tests as for single column tests, with 1000 ppm SO2 showing higher concentrations of Ti (135 ppm for single column, 407 ppm for looping test) compared to 0 and 2000 ppm SO2 at values close to 10 ppm Ti in both tests. Zn is the only major element showing a clear increase in concentration with SO2, increasing from 9.4 to 14.1 to 66.8 ppm for SO2 concentrations of 0, 1000 and 2000 ppm respectively.
