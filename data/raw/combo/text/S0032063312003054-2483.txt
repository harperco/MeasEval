Fig. 5 also shows an acceleration of heavy-ions between ∼01:25:00 UT and 01:25:40 UT, prior to the first signature of electron precipitation shown in the ELS spectrogram. Similar acceleration of heavy-ions is found around a number of other events of electron precipitation signatures. Further analysis of this type of acceleration of heavy-ions will be left for future work. However, we refer to these events as showing a “peripheral acceleration” of heavy-ions. We have included the identification of these events in Table 1 to compare with the results of the energy distribution categories.
