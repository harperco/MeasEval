A further finding from the upper panel of Fig. 12 relates to possible restrictions on combinations of electric field strength and 10 keV electron energy flux. The bottom left half of the figure (below the thick red line) represents a range of observed temperatures on Saturn (400–650 K) and thus of “allowed” combinations of electric field strength and particle flux. In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values. This combination of values cannot thus occur for extended periods on Saturn.
