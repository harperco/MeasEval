SEMâ€“EDS analysis of sorbent sampled from the carbonator after each test was undertaken to determine the percentage weight of the elemental species present. The results as shown in Fig. 8 confirm that increasing bed inventory generally increases the presence of Al, Fe and Cu. Al was identified in the unreacted sample at a weight% of 0.34, but this increased to similar values of 0.67% and 0.66% for 4.5 kg and 6 kg samples respectively, with a much higher value of 3.98% for 13 kg sample of sorbent. This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions. Although the values are small, a steady decrease in Si weight% was recorded with increasing sorbent mass, implying removal of Si from limestone in the capture process. However the lowest value was recorded for the unreacted limestone.
