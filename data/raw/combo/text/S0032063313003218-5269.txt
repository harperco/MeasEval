Melin et al. (2006) analysed infrared data from an auroral heating event observed by Stallard et al. (2001, 2002) (from September 8 to 11, 1998) and found that particle precipitation could not account for the observed increase in ionospheric temperature (940–1065 K). The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).
