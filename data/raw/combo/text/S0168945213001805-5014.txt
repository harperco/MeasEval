Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces a wide variety of δ-endotoxins, toxic polypeptides that are activated within the guts of insect herbivores. The individual crystalline δ-endotoxins produced by Bt strains are poisonous to specific orders of Insecta (lepidopterans, dipterans, coleopterans, hymenopterans) and nematodes [163]. Hence, simultaneous over-expression of several Bt toxins should produce a tree that would be poisonous to many insect herbivores that are likely to attack the host.
