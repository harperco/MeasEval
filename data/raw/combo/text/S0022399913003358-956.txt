UK prevalence estimates for tinnitus are relatively dated; data for the widely cited National Study of Hearing (NSH) [2] were collected in the 1980's. It is possible that prevalence figures may have changed since then, for example, due to more recreational noise exposure. In addition, neither the NSH nor any other large-scale, population-based study has provided comparisons between tinnitus and neuroticism. The objectives of this study were to provide a detailed description of the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population study of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years, according to age and sex, (following on from a previous study [5]), as well as to examine the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism.
