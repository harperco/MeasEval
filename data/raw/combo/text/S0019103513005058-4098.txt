Atmospheric temperatures affect photochemical rate constants and atmospheric water vapor content. These, in turn, affect the chain of reaction rates that lead to the oxidation of Cl to form HClO4. To pinpoint how atmospheric temperatures alter reaction rates, we shift the nominal Mars temperature profile to higher surface temperatures. The shape of the profile is preserved, but the surface temperature is increased from 211 K to 284 K (a temperature increase of âˆ¼35%), with the latter temperature being more representative of surface temperatures on Earth.
