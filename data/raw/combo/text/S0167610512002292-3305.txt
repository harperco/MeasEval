The results from three different simulations are presented hereâ€”one with a 1.0 kg plate, a second with a 6.35 kg plate (typical of a clay roofing tile), and a third with a 12 kg plate. The latter is rather heavy for a typical roof tile, but was used to test the range of applicability of the model. A uniform inflow condition is used, with the wind speed of 35 m/s (126 km/h) is used, which is within the range of full-scale failure wind speeds typically discussed by Visscher and Kopp (2007).
