Lithology in the CTBI includes interbedded shales, clays and mudstones, some of which are pyritiferous. The organic matter in the black shales is of marine origin, but includes a significant fraction of terrigenous material (Forster et al., 2008). The black shales are highly laminated and relatively undisturbed by bioturbation. The δ13Corg record is incomplete due to poor core recovery and low sample yield, but an excursion signifying OAE 2 is recorded: a 0.5‰ VPDB negative shift immediately precedes the 4‰ positive excursion, −27.7 to −23.7‰ (Fig. 2; Supplementary Material, Table 1f; Forster et al., 2008). The characteristic excursion spans ∼2 m of finely interbedded shales and mudstones. Throughout OAE 2, the δ13Corg values fluctuate between ∼−23.5‰ to −27.5‰. The maximum enrichment in the δ13Corg is at 1035.75 mbsf, ∼3.52 m into OAE 2 (Forster et al., 2008).
