For each of the 7 initial orientations, a case, numbered 4 in Table 2, was run using a 0.563 m square plate of thickness 0.025 m. The density of the plate was adjusted to ensure that at the mean horizontal wind flow, the Tachikawa number, K and Froude number Fr are the same as in the number 1 cases. The result is two sets of cases, A1 to G1 and A4 to G4, with the same set of initial orientations, aspect ratio and flow parameter but considerably lower thickness ratio, τ=t/L, and non-dimensionalised mass moment of inertia about the Z-axis, Δzz, in the A4 to G4 cases. Similarly a fifth case, numbered 5 in Table 2 is run for each initial orientation, and the plate's K, FrL, τ and Δzz are kept constant relative to cases numbered 4, but the width of the plate, B is increased to give a higher aspect ratio.
