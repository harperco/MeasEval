Table 5 shows that the regeneration density of different site types (upland improved farmland or upland moorland). Site type (upland improved farmland or upland moorland) produced a significant variation in total regeneration densities (F(3, 8.9) = 4.1, p = 0.03). 20% of the total observed variation was due to variation between the different site types. The overall regeneration density on clearfelled upland moorland was significantly greater than on unplanted upland moorland (p < 0.01). However there was no significant difference between the regeneration density of clearfelled improved farmland and unplanted improved farmland (see Table 5). No significant difference in regeneration densities was found between brown earth and peaty gley soils (F(1, 3.95) = 1.75, p = n.s.).
