It has been pointed out in the previous section that the spectrum can have a significant influence for amorphous silicon devices. The behaviour of devices will depend on the band gap of the absorber material and potentially on the window layer, where this is present. It is apparent from Fig. 7 that there is only a small spectral dependence for c-Si and CIGS devices. The absolute level depends on the normalisation, but in terms of relative changes in the generated short-circuit current, the effect accounts for about ±3% for CIGS and c-Si and +10% to −20% for a-Si devices. The overall impact on annual energy yield is slightly positive for a-Si devices and virtually zero for the other technologies.
