Carbon isotopic results of total organic matter (δ13CTOC) and amorphous organic matter (δ13CAOM) against core 22/10a-4 lithology and Apectodinium spp. (%). Blue=bulk rock δ13CTOC; black=δ13CAOM; solid red symbols=bulk rock δ13CTOC from samples with <30% wood/plant tissue (determined from palynological residue of the sample); open red symbols=bulk rock δ13CTOC from samples with >30% wood/plant tissue. The first appearance of Apectodinium augustum identifies the PETM in the North Sea (Bujak and Brinkhuis, 1998), and the first negative shift in δ13C identifies the approximate position of the CIE onset and the Paleocene–Eocene boundary. Values shaded at 2614.7 and 2619.6 m are considered possible outliers based on statistical analysis of the palynological residues (see Section 4.1). Lithologic column shows position of sand intervals (yellow), claystone intervals (brown; predominantly laminated claystone, dark brown), and ash layers (pink).
