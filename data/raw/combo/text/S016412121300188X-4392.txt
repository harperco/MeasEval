The accuracy of hash function H is given as Hashed Slice Precision, HSP = UH/US . A precision of 1.00 (US = UH) means the hash function is 100% accurate (i.e., it produces a unique hash value for every distinct slice) whereas a precision of 1/US means that the hash function produces the same hash value for every slice leaving UH = 1.
