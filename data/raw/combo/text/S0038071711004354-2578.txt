Undoubtedly, the possibility of having the CO2 production constrained within the top 30 cm of the soil profile, as well as estimating δ13CRs on a highly porous sandy soil, represented a fundamental advantage for the application of the three end-member model in this study. In a porous soil, the gradients in CO2 concentration and 13CO2 abundance adjust very quickly across depth. Thus, the soil CO2 and δ13C profiles reflect the depth-integrated CO2 sources (biotic processes) rather than the local fluctuations in production rates due to transient changes in CO2 diffusivity (abiotic processes) (Maseyk et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of partitioning soil efflux considering both the 13C discrimination of respiratory components and their mass-specific rate of CO2 production.
