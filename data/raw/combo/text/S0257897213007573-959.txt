Fig. 4 shows the AFM images and corresponding 3D profiles of SiC wafer, CDC layer and dual-layer film, indicating surface morphology evolution in the process. The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The size of carbon particles is up to approximately 3 Î¼m in diameter, and the surface roughness is substantially increased to 54.68 nm in RMS.
