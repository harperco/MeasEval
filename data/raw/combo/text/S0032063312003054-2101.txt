The product of the density with velocity gives the net flux of the particles. The difference between the net flux from electrons and the heavy-ions then provides a rough estimate of the current density. It is also important to note that it is not possible to obtain a direct measurement of currents caused by parallel electric fields using the ASPERA-3 ELS and IMA instruments. This is because we have been unable to find evidence of clear beams of both electrons and heavy-ions in opposite directions for the ASPERA-3 ELS and IMA data used in this study. Also, ASPERA-3 only measures a fraction of the entire distribution function and we are therefore limited to how accurately we can determine currents.
