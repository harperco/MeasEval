Increasing sink strength can lead to higher biomass yield. PHOTOPERIOD RESPONSE 1 is a gene in potato that has been associated with the accumulation of starch in the tubers. Over-expression of the endogenous ortholog of this gene in P. trichocarpa resulted in starch accumulation in stem and roots, and, consequently, significantly more stem and root biomass [110]. Many of the transgenic plants had malformed root systems that may have contributed to a 50% mortality rate in the greenhouse. Subsequently, the survivors were able to develop normal root systems. Careful selection for growth and vigor in the greenhouse phase and use of bare-root seedlings for transplanting may help ensure that only plants with satisfactory root systems are planted out in the field.
