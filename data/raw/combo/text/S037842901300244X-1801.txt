Due to the genetic load of the pearl millet landraces used (which were never self-pollinated before), the comparatively poorer seedling establishment of the S1 materials turned out to be a disadvantage in the S1 selection process, leading to higher experimental errors (lower heritabilities) in the S1 in the C0, C2 and C4 trials, especially for ASNPC and DM (Table 1). In the C0 evaluation, S1 progenies flowered three weeks later than the FS. This was due to poorer S1 plant establishment after a severe drought that occurred after planting. Relatively high panicle yield (484 g mâˆ’2) was recorded in C3 in the FS, which was due to the favorable 2009 rainy season conditions. Since both S1 and FS progenies were evaluated in separate field trials, and since both S1 and FS selection schemes were combined, a real comparison of means and selection efficiencies is not possible in this study.
