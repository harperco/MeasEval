Data were analysed by Philips Automated Powder Diffraction software. Phase identification was carried out using the Philips software routine, PC-IDENTIFY to access the ICDD PDF database. Unit cells were indexed using DICVOL91 [25]. Further data were collected over a longer period, from 5≤2θ/°≤120 with a step size of 0.02° over 14 h, in order to obtain data suitable for structure refinement.
