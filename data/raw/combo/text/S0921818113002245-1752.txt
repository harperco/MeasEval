In general the sediment units (fine detritus gyttja) become lighter coloured towards the surface of the sequence. There are, however, distinct changes in magnetic susceptibility within GU-3, which also contains a distinct layer of clastic sediment (approximately 1 mm thick) with high magnetic susceptibility at depth of 5.16 m. Magnetic susceptibility remains variable in GU-2, which is a lighter brown fine detritus gyttja. The onset of liming within the catchment causes GU-1 to be characterised by thin layers of light coloured non-dissolved calcium carbonate. The magnetic susceptibility of the freeze-core was not determined.
