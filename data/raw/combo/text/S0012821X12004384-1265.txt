A total of 71 palynology samples were prepared at the British Geological Survey using standard preparation procedures (Moore et al., 1991). Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C. Foraminifera samples between 20 and 60 g of dried sediment were processed by washing through a 63 μm sieve with water. All specimens were counted and converted to foraminifera/g (Table S2). All species exhibited agglutinated (non calcareous) test walls.
