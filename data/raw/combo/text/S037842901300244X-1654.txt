Data were collected at both sites on a plot basis for traits related to pearl millet phenological and agronomical characters, downy mildew (DM) incidence, and Striga resistance. The flowering time (FLO) in days after sowing (das) was recorded when 50% of the plants had exerted stigmas. During harvest, the number of productive panicles was counted and weighed to determine the panicle yield (HYD) (g m−2). The number of hills per plot with downy mildew was recorded at tillering, verified/adjusted after flowering and used for calculating the downy mildew (DM) incidence (in percentage): number of infested hills, divided by the total number of hills after emergence, multiplied by 100. In addition, the number of emerged Striga plants for each plot was recorded at 67, 101 and 121 das. Successive Striga counts were then used to calculate the “Area under Striga Number Progress Curve” (ASNPC) (Haussmann et al., 2000):ASNPC=∑i=0n−1Yi+Y(i+1)2(t(i+1)−ti)where n is the number of Striga assessment dates, Yi the Striga count at the ith assessment date, ti the days after sowing at the ith assessment date, t0 is 0, and Y0 is 0. Low ASNPC means values indicate resistance, and high values susceptibility to Striga.
