Illustrated electron drift paths for different energies near Enceladus in a perturbed electric field configuration. Only the equatorial plane is shown where x points in the flow direction and y points toward the planet. The energy is mentioned on the top of each figure, The parameter a = 0.1 is the assumed surface velocity of 10% relative to the upstream velocity.
