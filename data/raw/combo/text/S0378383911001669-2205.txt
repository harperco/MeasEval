Fig. 18 presents typical bed shear stress time-series estimated from the velocity measurements via the momentum balance, log-law and Reynolds stress methods. The example results shown are for x = 0.772 m on the 1.3 mm sand-rough and 5.4 mm gravel-rough beaches. The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method. Another benefit of the log-law method is that it has been extensively used in the literature, making comparison of our results with previous results more straightforward.
