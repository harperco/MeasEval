Input to the modeling consisted of the compressional wave velocity (Vp), shear wave velocity (Vs), and density (ρ) near the injection well obtained from borehole logging data (Fig. 4). Vp and ρ were vertically averaged from the logs to remove high frequency fluctuations. Vs values from the well Ktzi202/2007 were vertically averaged over the main lithological units (Förster et al., 2010). The resulting Vs model was linearly interpolated to the injection well using the interpreted lithological horizons after Kling (2011). The input wavelet was extracted from the 3D seismic baseline data (Juhlin et al., 2007) (Fig. 4), yielding a dominant frequency of 40 Hz. Seismic modeling with the reflectivity method using the previously described Vp, Vs and density models as input parameters resulted in a synthetic trace corresponding to a 3D surface seismic baseline trace near the injection well (Fig. 4).
