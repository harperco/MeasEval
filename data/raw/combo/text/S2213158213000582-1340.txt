Prior to VESTAL analyses, a 5–55 Hz bandpass filter was applied. VESTAL analyses examined activity 30–130 ms post-stimulus producing a 4D activation map (3D volumes across time) as well as a 2D source time-course matrix. The average percent variance explained for gradiometer data using VESTAL was 95.81% for HC and 94.38% for SZ. The average percent variance explained for magnetometer data using VESTAL program was 96.24% for HC and 93.17% for SZ. There were no group differences in percent variance explained for gradiometer data (t(39) = 1.16, p = 0.25) or magnetometer data (t(39) = 1.31, p = 0.20).
