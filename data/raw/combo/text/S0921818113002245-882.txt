Age–depth relationship and physical properties. The solid line in (a) shows the OxCal modelled age–depth relationship produced by integrating the radiocarbon wiggle-match of a series of 873 varves (Mellström et al., 2013) with a series of terrestrial macrofossil ages (labels 46–52.1.1). The dashed back line shows the approximate depths of an historically dated atmospheric lead isochron established in a nearby core by Guhrén et al. (2003). The sedimentation rate shown in (b) was calculated by interpolation between radiocarbon-dated levels, the AD 1850 lead pollution horizon (Guhrén et al., 2003) and the sediment surface. (c) Loss-on-ignition, which is relatively stable in the sediments above 10.5 m depth. The wet density of the discrete paleomagnetic samples is shown in (d).
