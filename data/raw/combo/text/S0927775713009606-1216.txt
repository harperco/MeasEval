Wide-angle diffraction patterns were acquired using a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer with CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å), over a 2θ range from 5° to 85°, using a step size of 0.1° and a counting time per step of 4 s. CdS particle size was calculated using the Scherrer equation, assuming a spherical particle morphology and using a Gaussian peak fitting procedure to determine the FWHM (i.e. K = 0.9).
