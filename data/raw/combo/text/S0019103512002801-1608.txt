Quantification of this time-of-flight effect gives us an outward radial velocity of about 5 km sâˆ’1, consistent in direction and order of magnitude with the local radial velocity measured by CAPS (Wilson et al., 2010). Our inferred radial velocity value is a factor of two lower than the one given in Wilson et al. (2010), but this could be due to a series of factors affecting mainly our technique, such as the uncertainties in determining the wake center or the assumption of constant radial velocity for all the time-of-flight interval.
