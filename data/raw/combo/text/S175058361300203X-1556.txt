The resulting synthetic seismic differences (Fig. 8) of both the 34 째C and 38 째C options look very similar and also show some similarity to the real data, also shown in Fig. 8. The synthetic difference (repeat-base) seismograms from near the top of the reservoir agree reasonably well with the real difference seismograms (repeat-base) for the Ktzi201/2007 and Ktzi200/2007 wells reported by Ivanova et al. (2012). However, obvious disagreements are found at the Ktzi202/2007 well, which may be due to the fact that the velocity model used at this location is not sufficiently correct. Seismic amplitude differences between the 38 째C and 34 째C scenarios correspond to less than 1% of the amplitude values of the baseline (Fig. 8). Since the normalized root mean square (NRMS) differences in the 3D time-lapse data are greater than 10% (Kashubin et al., 2011) these temperature effects in the reservoir will not be resolvable with surface seismic methods at the Ketzin site.
