Diurnally-averaged thermospheric temperatures, as calculated in simulation R15, are presented in Fig. 6 for the southern hemisphere (with those in the northern hemisphere being identical). We find daily variations of polar temperatures to be less than 6 K and thus virtually negligible, despite the strong diurnal variation of electron precipitation and thereby Joule heating (Fig. 3). The reasons for this are the long thermal time scales in Saturnâ€™s upper atmosphere combined with the fast planetary rotation rate. This justifies discussing diurnally-averaged quantities hereafter.
