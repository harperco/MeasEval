The elemental sampling method was undertaken in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 29: Determination of Metals Emissions from Stationary Sources [23]. The experimental set up, as outlined in Fig. 3, comprises a ‘sampling train’ consisting of several bubblers through which a stack sample of the flue gas is passed. Several bubblers contain aqueous acidic dilution to allow collection of condensed trace elements in the flue gas which passes through. A pump allows the gas to be sampled through the bubblers, and a dry gas meter allows the recording of the volume of gas which is sampled. A glass filter prevents particulate matter from passing through the bubblers. Prior to, and between each experiment, the glassware is acid washed in 10% HNO3 acid in order to prevent contamination. Further details of the procedure are provided in EPA Method 29 [23].
