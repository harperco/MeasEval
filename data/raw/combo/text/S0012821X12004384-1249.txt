Borehole 22/10a-4 (57°44’8.47”N; 1°50’26.59”E) provides a continuous core through the Forties Sandstone Member and into the Lista Formation (Fig. 2). The core consists of variably fissile claystone with interbedded fine to coarse grained sandstone layers interpreted as turbidites, with occasional mm-thick ash layers (Fig. 3). All samples in this study were taken from claystone horizons to avoid sampling substantial quantities of reworked material. The section of 22/10a-4 analysed in this study is from 2605 m to 2634 m (core depth), chosen because this part of the core is predominantly in claystone facies and provides a greatly expanded section over the onset of the CIE (Figs. 2 and 3). At 2609–2613 m the claystone becomes finely laminated with alternately pale and dark laminae couplets ranging from 1 to 25 per mm (Fig. S2). The pale laminae consist of clay and silt, and the dark laminae are rich in organic carbon and pyrite inclusions. Laminae were counted at 26 horizons throughout the core and approximately 13 pairs per mm.
