None of the mycorrhizal fungi when inoculated individually increased plant biomass. However, root growth responded positively to the G. mosseae plus G. intraradices combination, resulting in a mycorrhizal growth response of 115% on a whole plant basis and 169% on a root only basis (P = 0.001) (Fig. 2). The fungal combination that resulted in the lowest percentage root length colonised induced the highest mycorrhizal growth response.
