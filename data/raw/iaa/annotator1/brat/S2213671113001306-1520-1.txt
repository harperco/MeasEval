The Spectralis HRA/OCT device (Heidelberg Engineering) was used to acquire laser-interferometric reflectance OCT images of the retina and choroid, with resolutions comparable to a light microscopic section. Longitudinal and transversal line OCT scans through the center of the implant were taken with the 30-degrees-of-visual-field setting of the Spectralis. Volume scans were obtained with 60 μm distance between each scan with the device set to 20 × 20 degrees of visual field centered on the implant. To approximate human optical parameters to rabbit eyes, the Spectralis’ corneal curvature settings were set by default to 4.2 mm. Red-free and infrared cSLO images were taken at 30 degrees of visual field in the HRA mode of the device.
