The Sleipner plume profile, viewed from the southeast, circa July 2002. The figure shows the distribution of injected CO2 after 5 Mt of injected CO2 (Bickle et al., 2007). The nine plume layers are well defined aerially, having ponded beneath intra-formational shales within the Utsira Sand. The uncertainty relating to layer thickness is high. The ninth layer first appeared in 1999, indicating that the CO2 has migrated approximately 220 m vertically from the injection point (IP) at 1012 mbsl in 3 years. The left panel is a regional stratigraphic column: MSL, Mean Sea Level; SWI, Sediment Water Interface; The Nordland Group extends from the caprock to seafloor, and is subdivided into three seals: US, Upper Seal (Pleistocene); MS, Middle Seal (Upper Pliocene); LS, Lower Seal (Upper Pliocene); Utsira, storage site (Middle Mioceneâ€“Early Pliocene); HG, Hordland Group (Early Miocene).
