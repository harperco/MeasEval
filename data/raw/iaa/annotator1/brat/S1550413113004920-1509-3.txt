We recruited 147 patients from consanguineous pedigrees (parents of the proband were second cousins or more closely related) who were diagnosed with permanent diabetes before 6 months of age or were diagnosed with permanent diabetes before 9 months and had any additional clinical features that made a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes less likely. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents, and institutional review board approval was received for this study.
