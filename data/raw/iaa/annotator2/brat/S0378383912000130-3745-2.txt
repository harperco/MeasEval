For the 8.5 mm beach the modelling produces a reasonably accurate trend at x = 1980 mm, while at x = 2780 mm the model fails to predict the initial sharp rise and the decline at the later stages of the swash. In this case the discrepancy between experimental and numerical results is probably caused by the modelling, most likely by the limited capability of the groundwater module.
