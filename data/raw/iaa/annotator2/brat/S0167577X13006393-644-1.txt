Sintering of pure HA particles is usually reported to occur above 1000 °C. The choice of the sintering temperature is important as it has an effect on the properties of the resulting sample. Most investigators agree that pure HA (ratio CaP=1.67) is stable in an air and argon atmosphere at temperatures upto 1200 °C [18–20]. However, decomposition of HA at temperatures as low as 800 °C has been observed for calcium deficient HA samples [19].
