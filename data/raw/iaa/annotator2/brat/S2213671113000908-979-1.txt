GFP-expressing H9, BBHX8, and A1ATD-1 cells were generated by stable transfection using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (Vallier et al., 2001). GFP-positive cells were differentiated into foregut cells and then dissociated into single cells. An individually isolated GFP cell was then transferred into a well containing non-GFP-positive hFSCs. Wells were visually inspected 12 hr after plating, and wells containing a single GFP-positive hFSC were selected for clonal expansion.
