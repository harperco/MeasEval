However, lakes are especially prone to a reservoir effect, due to dissolution of ancient carbonates and/or old organic matter that is washed into the lake from the catchment and incorporated into the sediment. Both phenomena can result in anomalous 14C ages and an offset from the real age of the dated material, which is not necessarily constant through time in the sediment section (Geyh et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2007). This offset from the real age can be of the order of several hundred or even more than a thousand years if bulk sediment or carbonates are dated, and can thus lead to misleading or erroneous age models if it is not taken into account (Geyh et al., 1998; Bertrand et al., 2012). Sediment sections spanning time intervals with multiple tephra layers could therefore easily be miscorrelated if the tephra is not adequately characterised to back up correlations. Appropriate tephra characterisation can potentially also help in evaluating the reservoir effect in a sediment section by providing a tie-point in the age model, provided the age of the tephra is well known from one or more independent sources (e.g., 14C dating on charcoal incorporated in terrestrial deposits, for example the well-constrained 3.00\u20133.05 ka cal BP Alpehu\u00e9 Pumice (So-A) eruption from Sollipulli; Supplementary Table 1; Naranjo et al., 1993b).", "S2213158213001253-2433": "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5.

The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI\u2013fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1.

A combination of such factors, including reduced odd nitrogen fluxes, higher oxygen mixing ratios, and increased temperatures may have worked in concert to produce larger perchlorate:nitrate ratios. Specifically, if odd nitrogen downward fluxes and oxygen escape rates are smaller than currently thought, nitrate fluxes would drop while perchlorate fluxes would increase. In conjunction, as the surface temperature warms toward 280 K (as it does in the current equatorial summer) local perchlorate production fluxes could increase further. While it is possible to tweak the photochemical model into this mode, it is difficult to imagine a self-consistent scenario where all of these processes are working in concert to create high perchlorate:nitrate and perchlorate:chloride ratios on Mars, so we favor an additional source for perchlorate.", "S175058361300203X-1280": "Input to the modeling consisted of the compressional wave velocity (Vp), shear wave velocity (Vs), and density (\u03c1) near the injection well obtained from borehole logging data (Fig. 4).

This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach.

Since XPS is a surface chemical analysis technique (with analysis depth less than 10 nm), this suggests that the nanoparticles lying at the surface of the fibres were embedded in a thin layer of polymer. The presence of carbon observed by XPS at the surface of the HA nanoparticles might result from atmospheric contamination by CO2 and volatile fatty acids. At the surface of the CaP fibres, an additional reason for the presence of carbon might be the existence of residual atoms from the degradation\u2013evaporation of the PLGA polymer. This would explain the higher proportion of carbon when compared to the native HA nanopowder and why the ratio of oxygen to carbon is lower. The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature.

A plume of water ice molecules and dust released through geysers on the south polar region provides enough material to feed the E-ring and also the neutral torus of Saturn and the entire magnetosphere. In the time period 2005\u20132010 the Cassini spacecraft flew close by the moon 14 times, sometimes as low as 25 km above the surface and directly through the plume. For the very first time measurements of plasma and energetic particles inside the plume and its immediate vicinity could be obtained. In this work we summarize the results of energetic electron measurements in the energy range 27 keV to 21 MeV taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of the moon in combination with measurements of the magnetometer instrument MAG and the Electron Spectrometer ELS of the plasma instrument CAPS onboard the spacecraft. Features in the data can be interpreted as that the spacecraft was connected to the plume material along field lines well before entering the high density region of the plume. Sharp absorption signatures as the result of losses of energetic electrons bouncing along those field lines, through the emitted gas and dust clouds, clearly depend on flyby geometry as well as on measured pitch angle/look direction of the instrument. We found that the depletion signatures during some of the flybys show \u201cramp-like\u201d features where only a partial depletion has been observed further away from the moon followed by nearly full absorption of electrons closer in. We interpret this as partially/fully connected to the flux tube connecting the moon with Cassini. During at least two of the flybys (with some evidence of one additional encounter) MIMI/LEMMS data are consistent with the presence of dust in energetic electron data when Cassini flew directly through the south polar plume. In addition we found gradients in the magnetic field components which are frequently found to be associated with changes in the MIMI/LEMMS particles intensities.

(2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species. Work by Giovannetti et al. (2001, 2004) demonstrated that AMF hyphae frequently anastamose and could result in a large network of interconnecting hyphae. Within the current experiment, colonisation by G. mosseae resulted in a higher proportion of small soil pores to large ones and reduced distances between neighbouring pores. A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (\u223c0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001). In contrast, G. intraradices led to soil with a greater number of large pores and all combinations of G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between neighbouring pores. Bearden (2001) concluded, in a study of soil\u2013water characteristics, that AMF hyphae resulted in soils gaining groups of small pores which corroborates the current findings, although it is interesting that different Glomus species affect the size and distance between pores differently. Bearden (2001) used a combination of six Glomus species (including G. mosseae) in her investigation of vertisols. In contrast, Milleret et al. (2009) found no evidence of G. intraradices forming small diameter structural pores and the larger size of the pores relative to the AMF led them to conclude that pore development was an indirect effect of the mycorrhiza. Since the extraradical hyphae had a smaller diameter than the pores, the authors suggested that hyphal penetration of pores induced root exudation and increased microbial activity. The data in the current investigation show that plant roots, possibly by influencing the associated microbial biomass and not colonisation by AMF per se, positively affected aggregate stability. Previous studies (e.g. Bedini et al., 2009) showed that aggregate stability is affected by the plant-fungal system rather than by plant root metabolism. Hallett et al. (2009) performed an elegant experiment in which mycorrhizal-deficient and \u2018wild type\u2019 tomato plants were grown in an agricultural field soil amended with G. mosseae and G. intraradices. These authors demonstrated that aggregate stability and porosity were increased in planted soils irrespective of the plant type (and mycorrhizal status) and they conclude that roots drive the stabilisation of soil structure. Their experiment lasted for 84 days and during this time the soil experienced wet\u2013dry cycles which may have encouraged microbial populations to produce polysaccharides which in turn enhanced aggregate production. However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability. Whilst it has been shown before that different AMF species may affect aggregate stability (Schreiner et al., 1997), the focus here is on the effects of the mycelium in addition to the mycorrhiza. No correlations were observed for AMF hyphal abundance and soil physical properties, demonstrating that the differences observed may relate to growth patterns and mycelium architecture rather than density, or perhaps to AMF-specific altered C-exudation since AM fungi are known to produce extracellular soil proteins such as glomalin (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996). The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.", "S1084804513001987-7409": "In this section, we propose a strategy to further reduce the distortion area, which is called two-dimensional scaling.

We could not detect any apparent uptake in the other animals or at any other time points (Figure S2). Intriguingly, the serum level of IFN-\u03b3 temporarily increased at 2 months after the transplant in three animals (Figure 3C). An immunofluorescence study conducted at 3.5\u20134 months showed that MHC-II+ cells were more frequently found in allografts than in autografts, especially in the monkey with increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 (Figure 3D, No. 10). The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells.

L7/L12 is also phosphorylated, which can affect both conformation and binding to partner ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Ref. [37]). This modification has now been confirmed to be present in mammalian MRPL12 [59]. In eubacteria, association of L7/12 to the large subunit takes place via the L10 protein such that two L7/L12 heterodimers normally associate per LSU [60]. Interestingly these dimers are actively exchanged on the 70S molecule without disruption of the ribosomal particle [54,61]. The dimerization status and number of dimers attached to the human 55S has not been clarified. In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate demonstrated similar levels small subunit polypeptides including DAP3 and MRPS18B in subject and control samples. In contrast, the total amount of MRPL12 was reduced (Fig. 7B). In the patient the IP is restricted to MRPL12 in the large subunit or the fully assembled 55S with the total amount of MRPL12 being reduced as it lacks the \u201cfree\u201d population. The densitometric measurements indicate that the patient IP has ~ 49% MRPL12 compared to control, in accordance with the gradient and steady state data. ICT1 appears to be sensitive to the MRPL12 levels and so is reduced in both the IP (~ 58% of control) and in the steady state westerns (Fig. 4). The lower levels of MRPL12 could reflect loss of multimerization but since the region in the bacterial protein involved in multimerization is towards the N-terminus [62], this mutation is unlikely to have an impact on dimer/multimer formation. The translation factor bound dimer has been suggested to have an increased affinity for the ribosome [54,61]. Thus a possible explanation is that the mutation affects translation factor binding, thereby reducing the affinity of the mutant MRPL12 for the ribosome. If this were the case, however, then we would expect an increase in the pool of free MRPL12 whereas the subject exhibits a reduced pool of free MRPL12, which interacts with POLRMT [57]. The immunoprecipitation was performed using an MRPL12 specific antibody and so should contain all free MRPL12, MRPL12 associated with uncomplexed mt-LSU and MRPL12 as part of the fully assembled 55S. Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components. Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.", "S0019103513005058-3154": "The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of \u223c0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest \u2a7d1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014).

Neodymium isotopes are known to be sensitive to source changes in the Indus basin (Clift et al., 2002). In both offshore cores less negative \u03b5Nd (i.e., less continental, less Himalayan) is often, but not always, associated with higher smectite/(chlorite + illite) ratios. However, more negative \u03b5Nd values are associated with a range of smectite/(chlorite + illite) ratios (Fig. 10A) and the highest smectite/(chlorite + illite) values are never associated with the least negative \u03b5Nd values. The kaolinite/illite ratio (Fig. 10B) is associated with a range of \u03b5Nd values, both onshore and offshore. Overall there is no correlation between clay mineralogy and \u03b5Nd.", "S0012821X12004384-1640": "A negative carbon isotope excursion of 5\u2030 has been identified from \u03b413CTOC and \u03b413CAOM in an expanded Paleocene\u2013Eocene boundary section from the central North Sea Basin. Palynological (dinoflagellate cyst, pollen, and spore assemblages) and sedimentologic (C/N ratios and kaolinite distribution) evidence indicate major changes occurred to marine and terrestrial environments in NW Europe both preceding and over the CIE. Enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input from 4 m before the CIE may indicate tectonic uplift and oceanic restriction of the North Sea, supporting hypotheses for NAIP volcanism as a trigger for the CIE (Svensen et al., 2004), and/or increased terrigenous runoff and regional precipitation, supporting hypotheses of an enhanced hydrologic cycle triggering carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002). A peak in Apectodinium before the CIE is interpreted as an ephemeral increase in terrestrial runoff causing local eutrophication. Further enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input at and immediately after the CIE onset, coupled with evidence for sea level rise in coastal areas, indicate possible increased regional precipitation over NW Europe. At this location (paleolatitude 54 oN) increased precipitation would support the hypothesis that a poleward migration of storm tracks from an enhanced hydrologic cycle resulted from global warming during the PETM (Pagani et al., 2006b).", "S0019103512001388-1070": "H-band slit-viewing VLT images taken on 6 November 2011 UT, just two days before the close approach of BS1 and BS2.

When these images were taken, both detectors could not be in good focus at the same time.) It appears that only BS1 was recorded in this image sequence, perhaps because the filter penetration depth is too shallow to see the apparently deeper BS2 feature, which should have crossed the central meridian about 30 min after BS1.

Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp. and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study. CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43]. S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45]. Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47]. Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe that inhabits the mouth and upper respiratory tract, forms biofilms [48] and has previously been found in middle ear disease [49,50].

The maximum temperature in the H50 model is 11,500 K and the temperature peak is located near 1.5Rp (p = 0.3 nbar). As \u03b7net varies from 0.1 to 1, the peak shifts from 1.4Rp (0.5 nbar) to 1.9Rp (0.1 nbar) and the maximum temperature varies from 10,000 K to 13,200 K. It is interesting to note that the temperature profile depends strongly on the heating efficiency but the location of the peak and the maximum temperature depend only weakly on \u03b7net. This is because the vertical velocity increases with heating efficiency, leading to more efficient cooling by faster expansion that controls the peak temperature while enhanced advection and high altitude heating flatten the temperature gradient above the peak.

MIMI/LEMMS is able to measure the intensities, energy spectra, and pitch angle distributions of energetic charged ions and electrons separately in the energy range between about 20 keV and several tens of MeV. Particles are measured simultaneously from two opposite directions (low-energy telescope (LE) and high-energy telescope (HE)). Low-energy electrons and ions measured in LE are separated by a strong internal magnet. Electrons are bent towards the two different detectors E and F while ions are detected in detectors A and B. The HE consists of a stack of five detectors. The species and energy separation is performed by coincidence measurements between these detectors. Data are recorded in rate channels. The instrument is mounted on top of a movable turntable which rotates about the \u2212y-axis of the spacecraft within 86 s, nominally. The \u2212y-axis points in the direction of the remote sensing instruments (often pointed towards the planet or another object). Under this configuration MIMI/LEMMS is therefore scanning in the x\u2013z-plane of the spacecraft coordinate system allowing very good pitch angle coverage. Unfortunately the turntable stopped rotating in the beginning of 2005 for unknown reasons after the release of the Huygens probe.

Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called \u2018age-age\u2019 correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula \u00d7 alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula \u00d7 alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable\u2014in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.", "S0012821X12004384-1284": "All analyses were carried out at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory.

Furthermore, we will discuss a number of potential improvements and future research avenues. Our exposition will follow the optimization criteria listed in Section 2.1.7.\u2022Area consumption: For a suitable implementation, the total number of gates is O(nlogn) per node. This can be seen by observing that the complexity of the threshold gates is dominating the asymptotic number of gates, since the O(n) remaining components of a node have a constant number of gates each; using sorting networks to implement threshold gates, the stated complexity bound follows [48]. Trivially, this number of gates is a factor of O(logn) from optimal. We conjecture that in fact this complexity is asymptotically optimal, unless one is willing to sacrifice other desirable properties of the algorithm (e.g. optimal resilience). Assuming that the gate complexity of the nodes adequately represents the area consumption of our algorithm, we conclude that our solution is satisfactory in that regard.\u2022Communication complexity: Our implementation uses 7 (1-bit) wires per channel, and sequential encoding of the states of the main state machine would reduce this number to 5. All communication are broadcasts. Considering the complexity of the task, there seems to be very limited room for improvement.\u2022Stabilization time: Our algorithm has a stabilization time of O(n) in the worst case. Recent findings [49] show that a polylogarithmic stabilization time can be achieved at a low communication complexity; however, this comes at the expense of suboptimal resilience, a weaker adversarial model, and, most importantly, constants in the complexity bounds that make the resulting algorithm inferior to our solution for any practical range of parameters. Moreover, as formalized in [13] and demonstrated in Section 7, for a wide range of scenarios our algorithm achieves constant stabilization time. Considering the severe fault model, we conclude that despite not being optimal, our algorithm performs satisfactory with respect to this quality measure.\u2022Resilience: It is known that 3f+1 nodes are necessary to tolerate f faults [25,14] unless cryptographic tools are available. Since the complexity incurred by cryptographic tools is prohibitive in our setting, our algorithm features optimal resilience.\u2022Delays: As mentioned, the delay of wires is outside our control. Taking dmin+ and dmax+ into account in the quick cycle machine, we make best use of the available bounds in terms of the final frequency/synchrony trade-off. The delays incurred by the computations performed at nodes are proportional to the depths of the involved circuits. Again, the implementation of the threshold gates is the dominant cost factor here. The sorting network by Ajtai et al. [48] exhibits depth O(logn). Assuming constant fan-in of gates, this is clearly asymptotically optimal if the decision when to increase the logical clock Lv next indeed depends on all n\u22121 input signals of v from remote nodes. We conclude that, so far as within our control, the design goal of minimizing the incurred delays is met by our algorithm.\u2022Metastability: We discussed several effective measures to prevent metastability in Section 6. Our experiments support our theoretical finding that, after stabilization, metastability may not occur in absence of further faults. However, since metastability is an elusive problem for which it is difficult to transfer insights and observations to other modes of operation of a given system\u2014let alone to different implementation technology\u2014a mathematical treatment of metastability is highly desirable. Our model opens up various possible approaches to this issue. For one, it is feasible to switch to a more accurate description of signals in terms of signals' voltages as continuous functions of time. Another option choosing an intermediate level of complexity would be to add an additional signal state (e.g. \u22a5) for \u201cinvalid\u201d signals, representing e.g. creeping or oscillating signals. Assigning appropriate probabilities of metastability propagation and decay to modules, this would enable a unified probabilistic analysis of metastability generation, propagation, and decay within a modeling framework using discrete state representations. Such an approach could yield entirely unconditional guarantees on system recovery; in contrast, our current description requires an a priori guarantee that metastability is sufficiently contained during the stabilization process.\u2022Connectivity: The algorithm presented in this work requires to connect all pairs of nodes and is therefore not scalable. Unfortunately, it is known that \u03a9(n2) links are required for tolerating f\u2208\u03a9(n) faults in the worst case [26,27]. We argued for the assumption of worst-case behavior of faulty nodes; however, it appears reasonable that typical systems will not exhibit a worst-case distribution of faults within the system. Indeed, many interesting scenarios justify to assume a much more benign distribution of faults. In the extreme case where faults are distributed uniformly and independently at random with a constant probability, say, 10%, of a node being faulty, node degrees of \u0394\u2208O(clogn) would suffice to guarantee (at a given point in time) that the probability that more than \u0394/9 neighbors of any node are faulty, is at most 1\u22121/nc. Note that this implies that the mean time until this property is violated polynomially grows with system size. Using the FATAL+ protocol in small subsystems (of less than \u0394 nodes), system-wide synchronization will be much easier to achieve than if one would start from scratch. In this setting, \u0394\u2208O(logn) would replace n in all complexity bounds of the FATAL+ algorithm, resulting in particular in gate complexity O(lognloglogn) per node, computational delay O(loglogn), and stabilization time O(clogn) with probability 1\u22121/nc. Thus, this approach promises \u201clocal\u201d fault-tolerance of \u03a9(\u0394) faults in each neighborhood in combination with excellent scalability in all complexity measures, and realizing this is a major goal of our future work.\u2022Clock size: The constraint (1) entails that either clock size is bounded or large clocks result in larger stabilization time. This restriction can be overcome if we use the clocks of bounded size generated by FATAL+ as input to another layer that runs a synchronous consensus algorithm in order to agree on exponentially larger clocks [41]. Finally, we would like to mention two more prospective extensions of our work. First, building on our modeling framework, it seems feasible to tackle an even more strict verification of the algorithm's properties than \u201cstandard\u201d mathematical analysis. The hierarchical structure and formal specifications of modules seem amenable to formal verification methods. Such an approach should benefit from the possibilities to adjust the granularity of the model by the distinction between basic and compound modules as well as the restrictions imposed by the module specifications; more restrictive modules may be simpler to analyze, yet will guarantee the same properties as the stated variants. Second, it should be noted that it is straightforward to derive clocks of even higher frequency from the FATAL+ clocks. This is essentially done by frequency multiplication, at the expense of increasing the clock skew. We refer to Dolev et al. [13] for details.", "S0960148113002048-3775": "The generator efficiency, defined in Eq. (29), is presented in Fig. 13. Strategies A\u2013C lead to similar generator efficiencies, the two major trends being that increased average wind speed causes a higher generator efficiency while a higher frequency of the wind speed reduces the generator efficiency. In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies. However, the generator efficiency with the reference strategy is lower at high wind frequencies. This reduced efficiency is due to high resistive loss caused by the high generator torque during the rapid oscillations. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01\u20130.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A\u2013C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies above 0.003 Hz, the reference strategy causes a too low average tip speed ratio which reduces energy capture, see Figs. 10 and 11.", "S0960148113005727-903": "If load factors (also known as capacity factors) decrease significantly with age, wind farms will produce a lower cumulative lifetime output, increasing the levelised cost of electricity from the plants. If the rate of degradation were too great, it could become worthwhile to prematurely replace the turbines with new models, implying that the economic life of the turbine was shorter than its technical life, further increasing its cost.", "S0019103512004009-5033": "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2\u20133Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 \u03bcbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman \u03b1 transit depth of the order of 2\u20133% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.", "S1388248113001951-339": "Rate-capability of (a) NaFeO2 [12], (b) NaFe0.5Co0.5O2, and (c) NaCoO2 in Na cells.

According to the experimental results as shown in Table 9 and Fig. 4, we find that the computational time of both static (Algorithm 1) and incremental (Algorithm 3) algorithms are increasing monotonically along with the increasing of insert ratios. It is easy to get the incremental algorithm is always faster than the static algorithm when the inserting ratio increases from 10% to 100% according to Fig. 4(a)\u2013(e). In Fig. 4(f), we find the incremental algorithm is mush faster than the static algorithm when the inserting ratio is less than 85%, but slower than the static algorithm when the inserting ratio is more than 85%.", "S0378383912000130-994": "Definition of flow quantities in the confined region of the beach of cell i during uprush (left panel) and during backwash (right panel).
