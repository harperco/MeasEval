To obtain the parameters needed for this energy-based criterion, a finite-element analysis modelling study has been used to derive the change in strain-energy arising from the cavitation process, with the addition of the strain-energy stored in the particle prior to debonding. The applied stress used for these simulations was derived from experimental observations. Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size. It has therefore been assumed that the debonding takes place at an applied uniaxial stress of about 70 MPa, which equates to a hydrostatic stress at the crack tip of about 210 MPa.

The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The size of carbon particles is up to approximately 3 \u03bcm in diameter, and the surface roughness is substantially increased to 54.68 nm in RMS.", "S0032063312003054-2264": "It is possible to explain such observations in general if we consider MEX to be above a region that has accelerated electrons upwards, in which case heavy-ions could also be accelerated downwards. This may explain the appearance of the very low DEF of heavy-ions at \u223c400eV. However, due to the finite gyro-radius effect it is also plausible that the general behaviour of the heavy-ions flowing away from Mars may not change, even when passing an acceleration region. The gyroradius of heavy-ions with energies around \u223c10eV at the location of the accelerated electron signature is around 100 km, which is of a similar spatial scale to the horizontal size of a closed crustal magnetic field line at 400 km. Therefore, it is possible the heavy-ions do not remain in the acceleration region long enough to experience its effects.", "S0167819113001051-1550": "As expected our design did not deadlock whereas a conventional unit deadlocked roughly 2% of the times that a glitch appears. This is very significant as a single deadlock has the potential to cripple a link permanently (until the whole system is rebooted). Given the communication-intensive application model supported by SpiNNaker this would mean a network becoming highly degraded very quickly if glitches appeared.", "S0169433213008933-689": "To increase reflectance of the HSQ film and to avoid light transmission and reflection from the metal substrate, we sputter coated cured HSQ samples with a thin film of gold/palladium (80/20) alloy. We used the Balzers SCD 004 sputter coater, operated with 0.06\u20130.07 mBar pressure of Argon. Samples have been processed for 240 s at 30 mA current. A silicon wafer is always included to examine the effect of sputtering on roughness.", "S0378383912000130-1096": "Time-series of model-predicted (solid lines) and experimentally-measured (dashed lines) hydraulic head, H\u03b7, within the 8.5 mm beach at x = 1180 and 1980 mm.", "S0301010413004096-693": "Metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) complexes are a sub-class of porous solids which show great promise for gas storage and separation due to their high surface area, low framework density, and tuneable functional pore environment [3]. MOF materials are usually built up from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers to afford 3D extended frameworks with the formation of cavities ranging from microporous to mesoporous region. Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77 K) [4] with a record of \u223c16 wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6]. However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material. There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use. In situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at below 10 K has been used previously to determine the locations of D2 within a few best-behaving MOF materials incorporating exposed metal sites [7\u201312]. It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state. These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities. Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study. Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.", "S0006322312001096-1271": "There are caveats to the results reported here. We measured depressive symptoms using validated instruments, such as the General Health Questionnaire and CES-D, and information on prescribed antidepressant medication use (26,29,49). These instruments are not designed to make a psychiatric diagnosis of first or recurrent major depression (26,29); they defined only partially overlapping case populations and some misclassification occurred because antidepressants are also prescribed for conditions other than depression. Nevertheless, the associations of manifest CHD and stroke with depressive symptoms in our study are in agreement with previous research linking vascular disease to depressive symptoms and clinical depression (4,35\u201338,44). Furthermore, in a validation study of 274 elderly participants from our cohort, sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire measures with depression diagnosed based on structured psychiatric interview as the criterion are high, almost 90% for CES-D depressive symptoms and approximately 80% for GHQ symptoms.", "S0019103513005058-4349": "To semi-quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the deposition fluxes of salts to temperature, we forced the model temperature profile to higher values by increasing the temperature profile by 35% in 5% increments. Warmer temperatures significantly increase the formation of perchloric acid. Over the range tested, the deposition rate of perchloric acid increases by around six orders of magnitude.", "S0019103512003995-2579": "Fig. 4 shows the density profiles of H, H+, O, and O+ from the C2 model, and the density profile of H from the M7b model. The difference between the transit depths based on the empirical and hydrodynamic models arises because the C2 model has large temperature gradients (Paper I) and a gradual H/H+ transition rather than a sharp cutoff. The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown). This implies that the correspondence of the mean temperature of the empirical model and the pressure averaged temperature of the hydrodynamic model is relatively good but not exact."}
