However, the extent to which this association was attributable to vascular risk factors alone is difficult to assess in such a study design. In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression.

However, differences between the included and excluded participants were generally small. Our study is based on an occupational cohort, which, by its very nature, is healthier than the general population, so the range of vascular risk scores and the range of depressive symptom measurements are likely to be narrower. This being the case, the associations between the Framingham risk scores and depressive symptoms reported here could underestimate the strength of associations in the general population, although similar associations between manifest vascular disease and depressive symptoms in the present dataset and those from the general population suggest that our estimates are likely to be fairly accurate.

Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54 \u00b0N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments. The CIE onset is identified from organic matter \u03b413C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence. Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass. Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103 yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle. Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM. Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores. This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate. A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.", "S0012821X12004384-1178": "The PETM was a period of geologically-rapid global warming that punctuated a warming Eocene climate 55.8 Ma ago (Charles et al., 2011), and saw sea surface temperatures rise by 5\u20138 \u00b0C from background levels (Zachos et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2007). It was associated with a substantial injection of \u03b413C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (see Pagani et al., 2006a) over <20 ka (Cui et al., 2011), causing a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) between \u22122 and \u22127\u2030 in marine and terrestrial sediments (see overview in Schouten et al., 2007) lasting 170 ka (R\u00f6hl et al., 2007), and a prominent dissolution horizon in the deep sea signifying deep ocean acidification (Kennett and Stott 1991; Zachos et al., 2005). The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (\u03b413C of<\u221260\u2030) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).", "S0012821X12004384-1221": "During the late Paleocene\u2013early Eocene the North Sea was a restricted marine basin, characterised by siliciclastic sedimentation and high terrigenous input, principally from the Scotland\u2013Faeroe\u2013Shetland landmass (Knox 1998, Fig. S1). Core 22/10a-4 is located in the central part of the basin (Figs. 1 and S1) and is therefore disconnected from many marginal marine processes that could mask oceanographic signals (e.g. tidal or storm-induced erosion and slumping). Paleobathymetry estimates in the North Sea during the Paleocene and Eocene are difficult to constrain accurately, as the extant benthic foraminifera present in the Paleogene are found today living between 200 and >1000 m water depth (Gradstein et al., 1992), and are controlled predominantly by substrate and bottom water properties. However using a number of paleoecologic micropaleontology methods together (Gillmore et al., 2001), along with 2D structural restoration (Kjennerud and Sylta, 2001), broad agreement was found and central parts of the northern North Sea appear to have had paleodepths of >0.5 km in the earliest Eocene near 22/10a-4 (Kjennerud and Gillmore, 2003, Fig. S1).", "S0012821X12004384-1232": "As 22/10a-4 is in the deep (>0.5 km) central part of the basin, it acted as a depocentre and exhibits a Paleocene-Eocene transition sequence that is not only expanded but is also close to being stratigraphically complete. The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically <10 cm). Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study. During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100 m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996). This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2). Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996). The CIE at the Paleocene\u2013Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4. The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009).

Despite the limitations of this method, the large variation in the %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (ranging from 0% to 80%) clearly indicates that significant environmental changes in surface water conditions occurred during the CIE onset in the central North Sea, and is supported by coeval changes in the sedimentary carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (Fig. 10) which reflects changes in the proportion of terrestrial/marine organic material deposited in the North Sea Basin due to terrestrial runoff and productivity (see Section 4.4).", "S0012821X12004384-1415": "Dinoflagellate cyst assemblage 1 (DA1, from 2632 to 2618 m, Fig. 7p) contains high proportions of typically open marine and hence normal marine salinity associated Achomosphaera/Spiniferites spp., undifferentiated chorate cysts and Areoligera/Glaphyrocysta spp. DA1 also contains on average 5% peridinoid cysts including Deflandrea spp. regarded as a coastal/neritic taxon indicating high productivity and nutrient availability (Brinkhuis, 1994; Pross and Brinkhuis, 2005).

They proposed that overturning of this basin could have released greenhouse gases and triggered the CIE, although there is currently no direct evidence as marine records from the Kilda Basin remain rare (Nisbet et al., 2009). Our North Sea records likely indicate enhanced stratification also of the proximal and linked Kilda Basin before the CIE (Fig. 1).

A coincident reduction in I. hiatus swamp conifers indicates possible disturbance of nearby coastal environments possibly from flooding (see Section 4.5). An associated reduction in \u03b413C may have been caused by stratification of the North Sea from an enhanced halocline, trapping 12C-enriched organic carbon at depth.

A peak in Apectodinium before the CIE is interpreted as an ephemeral increase in terrestrial runoff causing local eutrophication. Further enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input at and immediately after the CIE onset, coupled with evidence for sea level rise in coastal areas, indicate possible increased regional precipitation over NW Europe.

This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions.

A plume of water ice molecules and dust released through geysers on the south polar region provides enough material to feed the E-ring and also the neutral torus of Saturn and the entire magnetosphere. In the time period 2005\u20132010 the Cassini spacecraft flew close by the moon 14 times, sometimes as low as 25 km above the surface and directly through the plume. For the very first time measurements of plasma and energetic particles inside the plume and its immediate vicinity could be obtained. In this work we summarize the results of energetic electron measurements in the energy range 27 keV to 21 MeV taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of the moon in combination with measurements of the magnetometer instrument MAG and the Electron Spectrometer ELS of the plasma instrument CAPS onboard the spacecraft. Features in the data can be interpreted as that the spacecraft was connected to the plume material along field lines well before entering the high density region of the plume. Sharp absorption signatures as the result of losses of energetic electrons bouncing along those field lines, through the emitted gas and dust clouds, clearly depend on flyby geometry as well as on measured pitch angle/look direction of the instrument. We found that the depletion signatures during some of the flybys show \u201cramp-like\u201d features where only a partial depletion has been observed further away from the moon followed by nearly full absorption of electrons closer in. We interpret this as partially/fully connected to the flux tube connecting the moon with Cassini. During at least two of the flybys (with some evidence of one additional encounter) MIMI/LEMMS data are consistent with the presence of dust in energetic electron data when Cassini flew directly through the south polar plume. In addition we found gradients in the magnetic field components which are frequently found to be associated with changes in the MIMI/LEMMS particles intensities. This indicates that complex electron drifts in the vicinity of Enceladus could form forbidden regions for electrons which may appear as intensity drop-outs.", "S0019103511004994-1399": "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS = 60,268 km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn\u2019s inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called \u201ctigerstripes\u201d on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).", "S0019103511004994-1511": "We use data taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini. MIMI/LEMMS is able to measure the intensities, energy spectra, and pitch angle distributions of energetic charged ions and electrons separately in the energy range between about 20 keV and several tens of MeV. Particles are measured simultaneously from two opposite directions (low-energy telescope (LE) and high-energy telescope (HE)). Low-energy electrons and ions measured in LE are separated by a strong internal magnet. Electrons are bent towards the two different detectors E and F while ions are detected in detectors A and B. The HE consists of a stack of five detectors. The species and energy separation is performed by coincidence measurements between these detectors. Data are recorded in rate channels. The instrument is mounted on top of a movable turntable which rotates about the \u2212y-axis of the spacecraft within 86 s, nominally. The \u2212y-axis points in the direction of the remote sensing instruments (often pointed towards the planet or another object). Under this configuration MIMI/LEMMS is therefore scanning in the x\u2013z-plane of the spacecraft coordinate system allowing very good pitch angle coverage. Unfortunately the turntable stopped rotating in the beginning of 2005 for unknown reasons after the release of the Huygens probe. Therefore during all the Enceladus encounters MIMI/LEMMS was not rotating anymore. Since then the low-energy telescope points at an angle of 77.45\u00b0 away from the \u2212z direction towards the \u2212x-direction (see Fig. 1). The advantage of that non-rotating mode is the time resolution of the instrument which is 16 times better than in the rotating mode (5.65 s) for the rate channels or 0.66 s for the priority channels instead of 86 s for a given pointing/pitch angle). This enables us to measure small-scale, short-lived features in the data set.", "S0019103511004994-1565": "An overview of the electron measurements from the MIMI/LEMMS instrument in the vicinity of Enceladus for the flybys E0, E12, and E13 is shown in Fig. 2. Those encounters were slightly north of the equatorial plane. The time period selected is \u00b110 min around closest approach which is marked by a solid line. Absorption signatures are clearly visible in most of the displayed electron channels C1, C3, E0, E6, BE, and G1 (same is true for those not displayed here). The nominal energy passbands are given on the right-hand side of Fig. 2. Only the measurements in channel C1 during flybys E0 and E13 show no absorption signatures (off scale for E13). As mentioned above the region in the vicinity of a moon where electrons are absorbed (upstream or downstream) depends on their energy. Therefore it is important to know the flyby geometry during each encounter. Fig. 3 shows the trajectory of Cassini during the flybys E0, E12, and E13 close to the moon inside of 10 Enceladus radii REnc. We show the spacecraft trajectories projected into the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes of a coordinate system where the moon is in the center (x in plasma flow direction, y towards the planet and z northward). This frame is often referred to as the Enceladus Interaction System (ENIS). The individual flybys are labelled with the flyby numbers E0\u2013E13, respectively. The measured differential intensity of electrons (56\u2013100 keV) as measured in MIMI/LEMMS channel C3 is plotted in a color-code along the trajectory. Blue means low intensities, red1 and white high intensities. Clearly visible is a lack of electrons in this channel in the vicinity of the moon. The highest count rates further away from the moon are more typical of a magnetospheric distribution in that region of Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere. The variation in the measured intensities are a combination of dynamic changes in the magnetosphere and from the fact that MIMI/LEMMS sampled different pitch angles during the individual flybys.", "S0019103511004994-1607": "Flybys E12 and E13 (middle and right panels of Fig. 2) were nearly identical in terms of the flyby geometry, directly above the north pole of the moon with a minimum distance of only 50 km. Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115\u00b0 during E12 and about 75\u00b0 for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field B\u03d5. We use sometimes the B\u03d5 component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfv\u00e9n-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in B\u03d5 could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a \u201cramp\u201d- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels.

Despite that, the main interaction mode of Rhea with the magnetosphere was shown to be plasma absorption. Magnetic field perturbations in Rhea\u2019s interaction region appear to be guided primarily by the formation of a plasma pressure cavity (wake) downstream of the moon and not from mass or momentum loading from the ionized products of this weak exosphere (Simon et al., 2012; Khurana et al., 2008; Roussos et al., 2008).", "S0019103512002801-1496": "Certain channels of LEMMS can accumulate counts with sixteen times higher temporal resolution than the typical rate channel time resolution (\u223c5.7 s).

These deviations do not necessarily mean the main interaction mode at Rhea is not plasma absorption. For instance, Simon et al. (2012) demonstrates that the combination of low magnetosonic Mach number and the high plasma beta values of Rhea\u2019s space environment amplifies interaction features which for other plasma absorbers (e.g. Tethys, Dione, Earth\u2019s Moon) are barely detectable. One of these features is a stronger, flow-aligned magnetic field component perturbation, which gives rise to mass-loading-like interaction signatures. Such structures may also complicate electron drifts, but to what extent it is uncertain. Similarly, the high plasma beta makes surface charging more important for Rhea compared to the other Saturnian moons (Roussos et al., 2010). Furthermore, recent developments in the study of Earth\u2019s Moon interaction with the solar wind indicate that the standard picture for a lunar-type interaction may be too simplified: processes, such as the entry of exospheric pick-up ions in the center of the wake, backscattering on the surface and self-pick up of ambient plasma ions, appear to also have an impact on the wake dynamics (Halekas et al., 2011). For instance, the self-pick up process has been shown to lead to enhanced ULF wave activity in the lunar, at least 10% of the time (Nakagawa et al., 2012).

The thermosphere component globally solves the non-linear Navier\u2013Stokes equations of momentum, continuity and energy on a spherical pressure level grid. The momentum equation includes terms such as pressure gradients, viscous drag, Coriolis acceleration, curvature accelerations and advection. The energy equation includes all processes of internal energy redistribution, such as advection, adiabatic heating and cooling as well as molecular and turbulent conduction. Solar EUV heating is calculated through explicit line-of-sight integration of solar irradiance attenuation (the Lambert\u2013Beer Law), assuming solar spectra derived from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)/Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) (Woods et al., 2005; Woods, 2008) and heating efficiencies of 50%, a value in agreement with estimates for Jupiter by Waite et al.

Our model is presently unable to reproduce observed low and mid-latitude exospheric temperatures on Saturn, illustrating that magnetospheric energy is not being transported from the polar to the equatorial regions.

As discussed in Section 3.2 (and shown for R15 in Fig. 6) the temperatures may be regarded as representing to within \u00b150 K exospheric and H3+ temperatures. While the values are based on equinox simulations, we found seasonal differences to be insignificant, generating temperature changes of \u2a7d10 K. The bottom panel of Fig. 12 shows as a function of 10 keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength the column emission rates of H3+ calculated from the vertical profiles of H3+ densities and temperatures of simulations R1\u2013R18.", "S0019103512003533-5251": "High latitude temperatures in Saturn\u2019s upper atmosphere published until recently had values below \u223c460 K (Melin et al., 2007; Vervack and Moses, 2012), but Melin et al. (2011) and Stallard et al. (2012) have shown that H3+ emission may be brighter than previously indicated, and temperatures hotter. Using high resolution Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) images, Melin et al. (2011) inferred temperatures of a segment of the auroral oval of 440 \u00b1 50 K. Even higher temperatures in Saturn\u2019s auroral oval of (563\u2013624) \u00b1 30 K were derived from Cassini VIMS observations by Stallard et al. (2012), so auroral temperatures on Saturn up to around 650 K are within the observed range. The thick red line in the upper panel Fig. 12 highlights the 650 K contour line and thus roughly separates values of polar temperatures that have been observed on Saturn (T \u2a7d 650 K) from those that as yet have not been observed (T > 650 K).", "S0019103512003533-5300": "The temperature changes with electron energy flux depend on the electric field strength that was set. For a moderate field strength of 80 mV m\u22121 the temperature is virtually constant when increasing the energy flux from 0.2 to 1.2 mW m\u22122, while at E = 100 mV m\u22121 it increases from \u223c550 K to 850 K. Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn\u2019s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).", "S0019103512003533-5318": "A further finding from the upper panel of Fig. 12 relates to possible restrictions on combinations of electric field strength and 10 keV electron energy flux.

In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of \u223c100 mV m\u22121 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m\u22122 generate thermosphere temperatures of \u223c800 K, well in excess of observed values.

This, in turn, may control thermospheric temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2, the region of magnetospheric electric field is considerably wider than the electron precipitation region, so the Joule heating region extends over a much wider region as well. Therefore, solar radiation does affect high latitude temperatures by means of its role as source of ionisation. This causes hemispheric differences in high latitude temperatures at solstice. In our solstice simulation (R19) we find exospheric temperatures averaged from 74\u00b0S to 90\u00b0S (the summer polar region) of 490 K, while averaging over the same latitude band in the northern (winter) hemisphere gives a value of 430 K. This difference of 60 K is a direct result of enhanced ionisation in the summer hemisphere, leading to stronger Joule heating there. We expect solar cycle variations of high latitude temperatures to lie within the same approximate range, stronger in the summer hemisphere than winter hemisphere, where solar ionisation is considerably weaker. The solar ionisation-induced hemispheric differences in atmospheric conductivity should similarly affect the magnetosphere, highlighting an interesting Sun\u2013atmosphere\u2013magnetosphere coupling chain that deserves more thorough examination in future studies.", "S0019103512003995-1237": "(a) The C II 1334.5 \u00c5 line of HD209458 (solid line, Linsky et al., 2010) fitted with a Voigt profile (see Table 1) and adjusted for absorption by the ISM (dotted line).

This detection was based on four transits observed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (Brown et al., 2001). The same data were later reanalyzed by Sing et al.

They found that the variability ranges between 1% and 37% during one period of solar rotation (27 days), and the average variability during one solar rotation was found to be 9 \u00b1 6%. This result agrees well with the estimated variability of the Lyman \u03b1 emissions from HD209458. The rotation period of HD209458 is estimated to be \u223c10\u201311 days (Silva-Valio, 2008). The G140M observations covered three different transits and took place within a month and a half. Each observation covered approximately 2 h in time. Thus the data can be affected by short-term variability and it is essential that such variability be properly accounted for. For this reason, we compare our models with the results of Ben-Jaffel (2007, 2008) and Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) who analyzed the data in the time tag mode and accounted for variability before calculating transit depths.", "S0019103512003995-2096": "K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman \u03b1 line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results).

Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 \u03bcbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010). Hence the mean temperature in the thermosphere of HD209458b is approximately 8250 K (the M7 model of K10).", "S0019103512003995-2579": "Fig. 4 shows the density profiles of H, H+, O, and O+ from the C2 model, and the density profile of H from the M7b model. The difference between the transit depths based on the empirical and hydrodynamic models arises because the C2 model has large temperature gradients (Paper I) and a gradual H/H+ transition rather than a sharp cutoff. The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown). This implies that the correspondence of the mean temperature of the empirical model and the pressure averaged temperature of the hydrodynamic model is relatively good but not exact.", "S0019103512003995-2681": "The cutoff level of the empirical model is somewhat arbitrary. For neutral species it is partly based on ionization (K10), but this criterion obviously does not apply to ions. With a cutoff level at 5Rp for the ions only, the M7 model yields line-integrated transit depths of 3.9%, 8%, and 5.8% in the C II 1334.5 \u00c5, C II 1335.7 \u00c5, and Si III lines, respectively, if 40% of silicon is Si2+. These values agree with the observed values to better than 2\u03c3. Similarly, by extending the cutoff level of the C2 model to 5Rp, we obtained transit depths of 3.2%, 6.7%, and 4.6% in the C II 1334.5 \u00c5, C II 1335.7 \u00c5, and Si III lines, respectively (see Table 2). These values deviate from the observed values by 2\u03c3, 0.9\u03c3, and 2.6\u03c3, respectively. The transit depths predicted by the M7 model are higher partly because the mean temperature of 8250 K is higher than the corresponding temperature in the C2 model (Paper I). This also leads to the higher Si2+/Si+ ratio that we used here.", "S0019103512003995-2737": "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5\u201310 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman \u03b1 and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109\u20131010 kg s\u22121 lead to the loss of 10\u2013100% of the planet\u2019s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than \u223c10 times the solar average on HD209458b.", "S0019103512003995-2760": "It is interesting to note that while the velocity structure of the escaping plasma can lead to broader absorption that helps to explain the transit depths, it is not necessarily detectable in the data. For instance, Fig. 7 shows the transit depths based on the SOL2 model that has a relatively high radial velocity reaching 11 km s\u22121 by 5Rp. The velocity structure is not detectable because the optical depth of the high velocity material is not sufficient, the LOS velocity at the limb of the planet is slower than the radial velocities in general, and because spectral line broadening within the COS instrument smooths the structure out of the line profiles. If the presence of velocity structure is confirmed in the data (Linsky et al., 2010), it probably implies that there is detached, optically thick plasma moving at large velocities around the planet. If this turns out to be the case, interaction with the stellar wind probably plays a role in giving rise to the observed absorption. Such interaction may also produce turbulence that can broaden the absorption further (e.g., Tian et al., 2005). However, we note that non-thermal broadening such as that proposed by Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) does not appear to be necessary to explain the current observations.", "S0019103512003995-3420": "This is the density of the material in the particles, not the density of the particles in the atmosphere.", "S0019103512003995-3548": "In agreement with K10, we showed that the H Lyman \u03b1 transit observations (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003, 2004; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010) can be fitted with a layer of H in the thermosphere that is described by three simple parameters. These are the pressure at the bottom of the H layer, the mean temperature in the thermosphere, and a cutoff level due to ionization. The most important parameters are the pressure at the lower boundary and the mean temperature. Because H is the dominant species in the thermosphere, the data can be used to estimate the temperature of the thermosphere. Choosing a lower boundary pressure of 1 \u03bcbar based on the location of the H2/H dissociation front in recent photochemical models (Moses et al., 2011) and observational constraints (France et al., 2010), we estimated a mean temperature of about 8250 K in the thermosphere below 3Rp.

Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 \u03bcbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.", "S0019103512004009-2930": "The differences between previous models arise from different assumptions regarding heating rates and boundary conditions. In addition to modeling the density profiles of the detected heavy species, we have improved these aspects of the calculations in our work. For instance, the lower boundary conditions are constrained by results from a detailed photochemical model of the lower atmosphere (Lavvas et al., in preparation). With regard to the upper boundary conditions, we demonstrate that for HD209458b the extrapolated \u2018outflow\u2019 boundary conditions (e.g., Tian et al., 2005) are consistent with recent results from kinetic theory (Volkov et al., 2011a,b) as long as the upper boundary is at a sufficiently high altitude \u2013 although uncertainties regarding the interaction of the atmosphere with the stellar wind may limit the validity of both boundary conditions. We highlight the effect of heating efficiency and stellar flux on the density and temperature profiles, and constrain the likely heating rates by using photoelectron heating efficiencies based on the results of Cecchi-Pestellini et al. (2009) and our own estimates (Section 3.1). As a result we provide a robust qualitative description of the density profiles, and constrain the mean temperature and velocity profile in the thermosphere. A second paper by Koskinen et al.

(2008a,b) used observations of the Na D line profile to constrain the temperature profile in the upper atmosphere. They suggested that Na condenses into clouds near the 3 mbar level, and thus predicted a deep minimum in temperature in this region that is required for condensation. The detection of Si2+ implies that condensation of Na in the lower atmosphere is unlikely (Paper II), and thus this result is unreliable. Relying on the same observations, Vidal-Madjar et al. (2011a,b) predicted that the temperature increases steeply from 1300 K to 3500 K near the 1 \u03bcbar level. However, their method to retrieve the temperature relies on the density scale height of Na to express the optical depth along the line of sight (LOS). This is not consistent with the argument that Na is depleted above the 3 mbar level. If such a depletion takes place, the density scale height of Na is not the same as the scale height of the atmosphere and it cannot be used to retrieve temperatures.", "S0019103512004009-3825": "A net heating efficiency of 50% is similar to the heating efficiency in the jovian thermosphere (Waite et al., 1983), and we may consider this as a representative case of a typical gas giant (hereafter, the H50 model). The maximum temperature in the H50 model is 11,500 K and the temperature peak is located near 1.5Rp (p = 0.3 nbar). As \u03b7net varies from 0.1 to 1, the peak shifts from 1.4Rp (0.5 nbar) to 1.9Rp (0.1 nbar) and the maximum temperature varies from 10,000 K to 13,200 K. It is interesting to note that the temperature profile depends strongly on the heating efficiency but the location of the peak and the maximum temperature depend only weakly on \u03b7net. This is because the vertical velocity increases with heating efficiency, leading to more efficient cooling by faster expansion that controls the peak temperature while enhanced advection and high altitude heating flatten the temperature gradient above the peak. As a result, the temperature profile is almost isothermal when \u03b7net = 1.", "S0019103512004009-3962": "Koskinen et al.

Alternatively, with \u03b7net = 0.5 it may imply that the XUV flux of HD209458b is 5\u201310 times higher than the corresponding solar flux. This type of an enhancement is not impossible. The activity level of the star depends on its rotation rate, and the rotation rate of HD209458 may be twice as fast as the rotation rate of the Sun (Silva-Valio, 2008). However, the uncertainty of the observed H Lyman \u03b1 transit depths accommodates a range of temperatures, and thus we are unable to derive firm constraints on the heating rates from the observations. In general, though, the pressure averaged temperature provides a useful connection between observations and temperatures predicted by models that can be exploited to constrain heating rates.", "S0019103512004009-3976": "The effect of changing the heating efficiency on the velocity profile is quite dramatic. As \u03b7net ranges from 0.1 to 1 (with the average solar flux), the velocity at the upper boundary increases from 2.6 km s\u22121 to 25 km s\u22121. However, the velocity does not increase linearly with stellar flux or without a bound \u2013 in the 100\u00d7 case the velocity at the upper boundary is only 30 km s\u22121. An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With \u03b7net = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with \u03b7net = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3. Basically the sonic point, when it exists, moves further from the planet as the high altitude heating rate decreases.", "S0019103512004009-4007": "In the previous section we discussed models where the net heating efficiency \u03b7net was fixed at a constant value at all altitudes. In this section we discuss more realistic models of HD209458b that rely on new approximations of photoelectron heating efficiency and derive an estimate of \u03b7net based on these models. Here we also include radiative cooling from recombination and, in one case, H Lyman \u03b1 emissions by excited H (Murray-Clay et al., 2009). Our aim was to calculate the most likely range of temperatures in the thermosphere of HD209458b based on average solar fluxes. Fig. 4 shows the temperature and velocity profiles at 1\u20135Rp based on different approximations (see Table 2 for the input parameters). Model C1 assumes a constant photoelectron heating efficiency of 93% at all altitudes and photoelectron energies. This heating efficiency is appropriate for photoelectrons created by 50 eV photons at an electron mixing ratio of xe = 0.1 (Cecchi-Pestellini et al., 2009). Model C2 is otherwise similar to C1 but the heating efficiency varies with photoelectron energy and altitude (see below). Models C3 and C4 are also based on C1, but C3 includes the substellar tidal forces in the equations of motion (e.g., Garcia Munoz, 2007) and C4 includes Lyman \u03b1 cooling. All of these models are based on the outflow boundary conditions for temperature, velocity, and density.", "S0019103512004009-4350": "The substellar tide is included in the C3 model. We included it mainly to compare our results with previous models (Garcia Munoz, 2007; Penz et al., 2008; Murray-Clay et al., 2009). The substellar tide is not a particularly good representation of the stellar tide in a globally averaged sense. In reality, including tides in the models is much more complicated than simply considering the substellar tide (e.g., Trammell et al., 2011). Compared to the C1 model, the maximum temperature in the C3 model is cooler by \u223c1000 K and at high altitudes the C3 model is cooler by 1000\u20132000 K. The velocity is faster and hence adiabatic cooling is also more efficient. The substellar tide drives supersonic escape (see also, Penz et al., 2008) and the sonic point in the C3 model is at a much lower altitude than in the C1 model (see Section 3.1.3). However, it is not clear how the sonic point behaves as a function of latitude and longitude.

We demonstrate this by reproducing the results of Murray-Clay et al. (2009) with our model. In order to do so, we set the lower boundary to 30 nbar with a temperature of 1000 K, and included the substellar tide in the equations of motion. We only included H, H+, and electrons in the model, and used the recombination rate coefficient and Lyman \u03b1 cooling rate from Murray-Clay et al. (2009). We also calculated the heating and ionization rates with the gray approximation by assuming a single photon energy of 20 eV for the stellar flux of 0.45 W m\u22122 at the orbital position of HD209458b. Fig. 10 shows the density profiles of H and H+ based on this model (hereafter, the MC09 model).", "S0019103512004009-5033": "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2\u20133Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 \u03bcbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman \u03b1 transit depth of the order of 2\u20133% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.", "S0019103512004009-5271": "We calculated the collision frequencies based on the C2 model, and found that collisions with neutral H dominate the transport of heavy neutral atoms such as O below 3.5Rp. At altitudes higher than this, collisions with H+ are more frequent. In Paper II we demonstrate that a mass loss rate of 6 \u00d7 106 kg s\u22121 is required to prevent diffusive separation of O (the heaviest neutral species detected so far) in the thermosphere. The mass loss rate in our models is M\u0307>107kgs-1 and thus O is dragged along to high altitudes by H. On the other hand, collisions with H+ dominate the transport of heavy ions such as Si+ as long as the ratio [H+]/[H] \u2273 10\u22124 (Paper II). This explains why Coulomb collisions in our models are more frequent than heavy ion\u2013H collisions at almost all altitudes apart from the immediate vicinity of the lower boundary. These collisions are much more efficient in preventing diffusive separation than collisions with neutral H.", "S0019103512004009-5507": "Koskinen et al. (2010a) demonstrated that the H Lyman \u03b1 transit observations (Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) can be explained with absorption by H in the thermosphere if the base of the hot layer of H is near 1 \u03bcbar, the mean temperature within the layer is about 8250 K, and the atmosphere is mostly ionized above 3Rp. These parameters are based on fitting the data with a simple empirical model of the upper atmosphere. The density and temperature profiles from our new hydrodynamic model agree qualitatively with these constraints, demonstrating that the basic assumptions of Koskinen et al. (2010a) are reasonable. This confirms once again that a comet-like tail (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003) or energetic neutral atoms (Holstr\u00f6m et al., 2008) are not necessarily required to explain the H Lyman \u03b1 observations.", "S0019103513005058-1737": "Concentrations of salts in Mars soil assuming deposition during the Amazonian, a soil density of 1 g cm\u22123, and mixing in a range of 1.5\u20132.6 m depth. Values are calculated for the nominal Mars case.", "S0019103513005058-3094": "In extremely arid regions on Earth, such as the Atacama Desert, nitrate, sulfate and perchlorate salts form in the atmosphere and accumulate on the surface from dry deposition according to diagnostic evidence in their oxygen isotopes. Salts of similar oxyanions should have formed in the atmosphere of Mars because of comparable photochemical reactions. We use a 1-D photochemical model to calculate the deposition rates of sulfate, nitrogen oxyanions, and perchlorate from Mars\u2019 atmosphere, given a plausible range of volcanic fluxes of sulfur- and chlorine-containing gases in the past. To calculate integrated fluxes over time, we assume that throughout the last 3 byr (the Amazonian eon), the typical background atmosphere would have been similar to today\u2019s cold and dry environment. If the soil has been mixed by impact perturbations to a characteristic depth of \u223c2 m during this time, given a time-average volcanic flux 0.1% of the modern terrestrial volcanic flux, the model suggests that the soil would have accumulated 1.0\u20131.7 wt.% SO42- and 0.2\u20130.4 wt.% N in the form of pernitrate (peroxynitrate) or nitrate. The calculated sulfate concentration is consistent with in situ observations of soils from rovers and landers and orbital gamma ray spectroscopy. However, nitrates or pernitrates are yet to be detected. The modeled formation of perchlorate via purely gas-phase oxidation of volcanically-derived chlorine is insufficient by orders of magnitude to explain 0.4\u20130.6 wt.% ClO4- measured by NASA\u2019s Phoenix Lander. The far smaller amount of ozone in the martian atmosphere compared to the terrestrial atmosphere and the colder, drier conditions are the cause of lower rates of gas phase oxidation of chlorine volatiles to perchloric acid. Our calculations imply that non-gas-phase processes not included in the photochemical model, such as heterogeneous reactions, are likely important for the formation of perchlorate and are yet to be identified.", "S0019103513005058-3154": "The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of \u223c0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest \u2a7d1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.", "S0019103513005058-3189": "Salts are relevant to the habitability of Mars. First, perchlorate reduction is a metabolism used by some terrestrial bacteria in anaerobic conditions (Coates and Achenbach, 2004). If such organisms exist (or did exist) on Mars, then they could gain energy by reducing perchlorate and oxidizing an electron donor such as organic carbon or ferrous iron. This would require organic molecules to be present on Mars. Indigenous organic molecules have yet to be confirmed on Mars; however the presence of perchlorate itself may have inhibited the detection of organics on Mars in pyrolysis experiments (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010). Second, perchlorate salts are highly deliquescent and significantly lower the freezing point of liquid water (Gough et al., 2011). The eutectic point of Mg(ClO4)2 is \u221257 \u00b0C (Stillman and Grimm, 2011), while that of Ca(ClO4)2 is \u221275 \u00b0C (Pestova et al., 2005). Given typical soil salt concentrations, small amounts of water (\u223c0.02 g H2O per g soil) would permit a water activity sufficient for terrestrial life to be viable (Kounaves et al., 2010b). Third, if all organisms require fixed nitrogen in proteins and nucleic acids, as they do on Earth, then the discovery of nitrogen oxyanions on Mars would be significant as well.", "S0019103513005058-3917": "Most gases are removed from the atmosphere to the surface according to a prescribed deposition velocity. The deposition velocity is a scaling factor that affects the transport of species from the bulk atmosphere to the surface in the absence of rain. The deposition velocity is coupled to the gas concentrations computed by chemical kinetics. Following Zahnle et al. (2008), we apply a deposition velocity of 0.02 cm s\u22121 to all species, with two exceptions. First, the deposition velocities for O2, H2, and CO are set to zero (following Zahnle et al., 2008). Second, all species with a zero deposition velocity in Catling et al. (2010) are prescribed a zero deposition velocity because we consider them to be nonreactive. These species include NO3, N2O5, N2O, CH3O, CH3ONO, CH3ONO2, CH2ONO2, CH3O2, CH3OH, CH2OOH, Cl2, CH2OH, CH2O2, OClO, ClOO, ClONO, ClNO, ClNO2, CH3OCl, Cl2O2, Cl2O, ClO3, and Cl2O4. The deposition velocity multiplied by the species number density at the lower boundary, in addition to the flux term from eddy diffusion, determines the flux of species to the surface.", "S0019103513005058-4098": "Atmospheric temperatures affect photochemical rate constants and atmospheric water vapor content. These, in turn, affect the chain of reaction rates that lead to the oxidation of Cl to form HClO4. To pinpoint how atmospheric temperatures alter reaction rates, we shift the nominal Mars temperature profile to higher surface temperatures. The shape of the profile is preserved, but the surface temperature is increased from 211 K to 284 K (a temperature increase of \u223c35%), with the latter temperature being more representative of surface temperatures on Earth.", "S0019103513005058-4158": "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51\u20130.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5\u20132.6 m depth, with a mean \u223c2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm\u22123 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.", "S0019103513005058-4175": "The sulfate deposition flux produced in the nominal model is compatible with estimates of the amount of sulfates on Mars. The nominal range (1.0\u20131.7 wt.% SO4) is consistent with 1.3 wt.% soluble sulfate measured at the Phoenix landing site (Kounaves et al., 2010b). The estimates also compare well with an average \u223c6.8 wt.% sulfur as SO3 (2.7 wt.% S) in global soil inferred from elemental abundances measured at various locations on Mars by Spirit, Opportunity, Pathfinder, and Viking Landers. We can also compare the average sulfur content in the top few tens of centimeters of the soil of \u223c4.4 wt.% inferred from Gamma Ray Spectrometer measurements (King and McLennan, 2010). The agreement between model results and data suggest that 0.1% of the terrestrial volcanic gas flux is a good estimate for the volcanic emission rate on Mars 1\u20132 Ga if soil salts derive from volcanic input.", "S0019103513005058-4210": "The model-inferred abundances of perchlorate are far smaller than observations, however. If we assume the soil is mixed to an average depth of 2 m and the parent salt is Ca(ClO4)2 or Mg(ClO4)2, then we calculate concentrations of 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 wt. % and 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 wt. %, respectively. These concentrations are both many orders of magnitude lower than the observed abundance at the Phoenix landing site: 0.4\u20130.6 wt. % (Hecht et al., 2009). Also, the concentrations are far below what would be inferred from observations of perchlorate:nitrate ratios \u223c1:60 measured in EETA79001 (Kounaves et al., 2014) and the Atacama perchlorate:nitrate of \u223c1:1000. Distinct from the results for Earth where gas phase reactions were sufficient to reproduce data (Catling et al., 2010), we conclude that additional heterogeneous reactions must be present to account for the efficient formation of perchlorate on Mars, a hypothesis we discuss further in Section 7. But first we explore the sensitivity of deposition fluxes to model parameters.", "S0019103513005058-4302": "As stated previously, there is considerable uncertainty in the input rate of odd nitrogen (N and NO) species from the martian ionosphere to the neutral atmosphere (Krasnopolsky, 1993). In his own model of the neutral atmosphere, Krasnopolsky considers cases both with and without input of odd nitrogen from the upper atmosphere (Krasnopolsky, 1993). We vary the input of N and NO into the model, using the nominal case as an upper limit. As these values are decreased, the pernitrate deposition flux drops, which is shown in Fig. 5. The lowest input of odd nitrogen corresponds to 3.5\u20136.1 (\u00d710\u22124) wt.% N accumulated over 3 byr and mixed into 1.5\u20132.6 m of soil.", "S0019103513005058-4349": "To semi-quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the deposition fluxes of salts to temperature, we forced the model temperature profile to higher values by increasing the temperature profile by 35% in 5% increments. Warmer temperatures significantly increase the formation of perchloric acid. Over the range tested, the deposition rate of perchloric acid increases by around six orders of magnitude.", "S0019103513005058-4499": "The purpose of the sensitivity tests was not to model a physically plausible environment on Mars; however, the tests revealed that no one factor could perturb the nominal model to produce amounts of perchlorate that approach the amount measured by the Phoenix Lander. A combination of such factors, including reduced odd nitrogen fluxes, higher oxygen mixing ratios, and increased temperatures may have worked in concert to produce larger perchlorate:nitrate ratios. Specifically, if odd nitrogen downward fluxes and oxygen escape rates are smaller than currently thought, nitrate fluxes would drop while perchlorate fluxes would increase. In conjunction, as the surface temperature warms toward 280 K (as it does in the current equatorial summer) local perchlorate production fluxes could increase further. While it is possible to tweak the photochemical model into this mode, it is difficult to imagine a self-consistent scenario where all of these processes are working in concert to create high perchlorate:nitrate and perchlorate:chloride ratios on Mars, so we favor an additional source for perchlorate.", "S0021979713004438-1401": "To obtain a relatively stable substrate during the measurements, all iron substrates were pre-conditioned in a 10 wt.% NaOH solution overnight to form a thin oxidized surface layer, followed by rinsing with 99.5% pure ethanol and drying with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas prior to use. The alkaline treatment of the iron surface results in formation of hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3), which will be shown and discussed in relation to Fig. 9. The hematite surface contains different types of surface hydroxyl groups that differ by their coordination to the substrate [26]. The hematite surface is amphoteric due to the possibility of protonization and deprotonization of the surface hydroxyl groups. In neutral solution, the \u03be-potential has been found to be slightly positive [27,28]. The water contact angle on our hematite surface is 69 \u00b1 3\u00b0, and the open circuit potential relative to Ag/AgCl is \u22120.72 V, which is similar to that of iron due to the small thickness of the oxide layer.", "S0021979713004438-1415": "A QCM-D instrument, which is a highly sensitive balance based on the measurement of changes in the resonance frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator, was used to study the film formation and complexation processes.

The temperature of the measuring cell was controlled at 25 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b0C, and the resonant frequency of the oscillator (f) and the energy dissipation value (D) were recorded simultaneously as a function of time. The baseline was determined using the buffer solution without protein.", "S0021979713004438-1907": "The adsorption of Mefp-1 on an oxidized iron surface was followed in real time using QCM-D as illustrated in Fig. 2. The sensed mass determined with QCM-D includes the mass of the adsorbed protein and that of water that is hydrodynamically coupled to the layer. This mass will be referred to as the \u201csensed mass\u201d in this article to distinguish it from the adsorbed mass of the protein. The exposure to the Mefp-1 solution leads to initial rapid adsorption, as expected for a protein showing high affinity for the adsorbent. After this initial rapid adsorption, a slower increase in the sensed mass is observed, suggesting a continuous build-up of the Mefp-1 layer. Since the substrate is a pre-conditioned iron surface that is not as stable as a model silica surface, the adsorption of Mefp-1 was interrupted after 10 min to prevent non-negligible corrosion of the substrate within the period of measurement. The protein solution was removed by injection of a protein free 10 \u03bcm FeCl3 solution into the cell, which allows the investigation of Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the pre-adsorbed protein layer. As shown in Fig. 2, the exposure of the adsorbed layer to the FeCl3 solution leads to a decrease in the sensed mass, which can arise from removal of some loosely bound Mefp-1 and/or some of the coupled water in the protein layer. Further information can be obtained from the change in the dissipation (\u0394D) values.", "S0021979713004438-1969": "In situ nano-mechanical mapping was performed on an iron substrate with a pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 layer, immersed in the citric acid buffer solution and the 10 \u03bcM FeCl3 solution, respectively. The topography images are shown in Fig. 4, presenting the starting surface in the buffer solution at pH 7\u20138 (Fig. 4a). Since the iron surface was pre-conditioned in 10% NaOH, the surface mainly consists of Fe2O3 as confirmed by the CRM measurement. The Rq value is 3.91 nm over a 500 nm \u00d7 500 nm scanned area. The topograpical images of the Mefp-1 layer adsorbed on the iron surface in the buffer solution and in the FeCl3 solution are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. The adsorption of the protein leads to a smearing of the features seen on the surface prior to the Mefp-1 adsorption, compare Fig. 4a and b. By comparing the Z-range of the surface with and without the Mefp-1 film (Table 1), it is seen that the adsorption of Mefp-1 does not lead to any significant change in the height variation, which indicates a full coverage of the Mefp-1 film on the surface. Fig. 4c presents the topography of the Mefp-1 film exposed to the FeCl3 solution; by comparing with Fig. 4b and the Z-range in Table 1, it is observed that the introduction of Fe3+ induced a negligible decrease in the height variation, which remains predominantly due to the roughness of the substrate surface.", "S0021979713004438-2004": "In addition to the topography images, the Peak Force tapping AFM measurements also provide information on nano-scale mechanical properties of the surface, i.e., deformation, adhesion, dissipation, and elastic modulus. The images in Fig. 5 show the nano-mechanical properties of the different surfaces, obtained simultaneously with the topography images in Fig. 4, respectively. The calculated mean values of each mechanical property image for the adsorbed Mefp-1 films before and after exposure to the FeCl3 solution are provided in Table 2. The property images in Fig. 5 and mean values in Table 2 show that the Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the adsorbed Mefp-1 film results in less deformation, a slightly lower adhesion force between the tip and the adsorbed protein film, and a lower energy dissipation as the tip is tapping over the surface. The DMT modulus data are fitted values from curves obtained as the tip is retracted after the initial deformation, which is a measure of the surface hardness. The results clearly show that Fe3+ complexation of the adsorbed Mefp-1 film results in a large increase in the modulus (average value from 38 MPa to 185 MPa).", "S0021979713004438-2148": "Fig. 8 shows the in situ ATR-FTIR spectra of the oxidized iron surface with pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film obtained after exposure to the 10 \u03bcM FeCl3 solution for different times. Comparing with the 15 min Mefp-1 spectrum (Fig. 6a), the intensity of negative water band is relatively larger after exposing the Mefp-1 layer to the FeCl3 solution (Fig. 8a), which indicates that water is released from the pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 layer. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the addition of the Fe3+ makes the Mefp-1 film more compact, in agreement with the QCM-D and AFM results. It should be noted that the spectra obtained with the addition of FeCl3 are remarkably similar to those without the FeCl3 addition but after sufficiently long exposure in the Mefp-1 solution, which indicates that Fe3+ could also be generated from the oxidized iron surface. We note that the broad and unresolved 1540 cm\u22121 peak is more clearly split into two separate peaks at 1550 cm\u22121 and 1536 cm\u22121 (Fig. 8b). This is not surprising since the DFT analysis showed that the 1540 cm\u22121 peak had contributions from both the backbone and the catechol unit, and that these bands may be influenced differently by the change in aqueous solvation when the water content of the protein film becomes reduced. It should also be recognized that the effect of subtracting the water spectrum may influence the two spectra slightly differently in this region. However, more importantly the peaks, at 1485 cm\u22121 and 1260 cm\u22121 (Fig. 8b), which we have associated with the complexation between catechol and Fe3+, remain largely unaltered both in terms of frequencies and intensities. This supports our earlier hypothesis that Fe3+ could be generated from the oxidized iron surface during the exposure to Mefp-1 solution and forms [Fe(Cat)3]3\u2212 complexes.. The shoulder at 1423 cm\u22121 (marked with arrow in Fig. 8b) seems to be slightly enhanced upon addition of FeCl3, and this could indicate some differences in the geometry of the complexes.", "S0022000014000026-12523": "Watchdog timers.

Furthermore, we will discuss a number of potential improvements and future research avenues. Our exposition will follow the optimization criteria listed in Section 2.1.7.\u2022Area consumption: For a suitable implementation, the total number of gates is O(nlogn) per node. This can be seen by observing that the complexity of the threshold gates is dominating the asymptotic number of gates, since the O(n) remaining components of a node have a constant number of gates each; using sorting networks to implement threshold gates, the stated complexity bound follows [48]. Trivially, this number of gates is a factor of O(logn) from optimal. We conjecture that in fact this complexity is asymptotically optimal, unless one is willing to sacrifice other desirable properties of the algorithm (e.g. optimal resilience). Assuming that the gate complexity of the nodes adequately represents the area consumption of our algorithm, we conclude that our solution is satisfactory in that regard.\u2022Communication complexity: Our implementation uses 7 (1-bit) wires per channel, and sequential encoding of the states of the main state machine would reduce this number to 5. All communication are broadcasts. Considering the complexity of the task, there seems to be very limited room for improvement.\u2022Stabilization time: Our algorithm has a stabilization time of O(n) in the worst case. Recent findings [49] show that a polylogarithmic stabilization time can be achieved at a low communication complexity; however, this comes at the expense of suboptimal resilience, a weaker adversarial model, and, most importantly, constants in the complexity bounds that make the resulting algorithm inferior to our solution for any practical range of parameters. Moreover, as formalized in [13] and demonstrated in Section 7, for a wide range of scenarios our algorithm achieves constant stabilization time. Considering the severe fault model, we conclude that despite not being optimal, our algorithm performs satisfactory with respect to this quality measure.\u2022Resilience: It is known that 3f+1 nodes are necessary to tolerate f faults [25,14] unless cryptographic tools are available. Since the complexity incurred by cryptographic tools is prohibitive in our setting, our algorithm features optimal resilience.\u2022Delays: As mentioned, the delay of wires is outside our control. Taking dmin+ and dmax+ into account in the quick cycle machine, we make best use of the available bounds in terms of the final frequency/synchrony trade-off. The delays incurred by the computations performed at nodes are proportional to the depths of the involved circuits. Again, the implementation of the threshold gates is the dominant cost factor here. The sorting network by Ajtai et al. [48] exhibits depth O(logn). Assuming constant fan-in of gates, this is clearly asymptotically optimal if the decision when to increase the logical clock Lv next indeed depends on all n\u22121 input signals of v from remote nodes. We conclude that, so far as within our control, the design goal of minimizing the incurred delays is met by our algorithm.\u2022Metastability: We discussed several effective measures to prevent metastability in Section 6. Our experiments support our theoretical finding that, after stabilization, metastability may not occur in absence of further faults. However, since metastability is an elusive problem for which it is difficult to transfer insights and observations to other modes of operation of a given system\u2014let alone to different implementation technology\u2014a mathematical treatment of metastability is highly desirable. Our model opens up various possible approaches to this issue. For one, it is feasible to switch to a more accurate description of signals in terms of signals' voltages as continuous functions of time. Another option choosing an intermediate level of complexity would be to add an additional signal state (e.g. \u22a5) for \u201cinvalid\u201d signals, representing e.g. creeping or oscillating signals. Assigning appropriate probabilities of metastability propagation and decay to modules, this would enable a unified probabilistic analysis of metastability generation, propagation, and decay within a modeling framework using discrete state representations. Such an approach could yield entirely unconditional guarantees on system recovery; in contrast, our current description requires an a priori guarantee that metastability is sufficiently contained during the stabilization process.\u2022Connectivity: The algorithm presented in this work requires to connect all pairs of nodes and is therefore not scalable. Unfortunately, it is known that \u03a9(n2) links are required for tolerating f\u2208\u03a9(n) faults in the worst case [26,27]. We argued for the assumption of worst-case behavior of faulty nodes; however, it appears reasonable that typical systems will not exhibit a worst-case distribution of faults within the system. Indeed, many interesting scenarios justify to assume a much more benign distribution of faults. In the extreme case where faults are distributed uniformly and independently at random with a constant probability, say, 10%, of a node being faulty, node degrees of \u0394\u2208O(clogn) would suffice to guarantee (at a given point in time) that the probability that more than \u0394/9 neighbors of any node are faulty, is at most 1\u22121/nc. Note that this implies that the mean time until this property is violated polynomially grows with system size. Using the FATAL+ protocol in small subsystems (of less than \u0394 nodes), system-wide synchronization will be much easier to achieve than if one would start from scratch. In this setting, \u0394\u2208O(logn) would replace n in all complexity bounds of the FATAL+ algorithm, resulting in particular in gate complexity O(lognloglogn) per node, computational delay O(loglogn), and stabilization time O(clogn) with probability 1\u22121/nc. Thus, this approach promises \u201clocal\u201d fault-tolerance of \u03a9(\u0394) faults in each neighborhood in combination with excellent scalability in all complexity measures, and realizing this is a major goal of our future work.\u2022Clock size: The constraint (1) entails that either clock size is bounded or large clocks result in larger stabilization time. This restriction can be overcome if we use the clocks of bounded size generated by FATAL+ as input to another layer that runs a synchronous consensus algorithm in order to agree on exponentially larger clocks [41]. Finally, we would like to mention two more prospective extensions of our work. First, building on our modeling framework, it seems feasible to tackle an even more strict verification of the algorithm's properties than \u201cstandard\u201d mathematical analysis. The hierarchical structure and formal specifications of modules seem amenable to formal verification methods. Such an approach should benefit from the possibilities to adjust the granularity of the model by the distinction between basic and compound modules as well as the restrictions imposed by the module specifications; more restrictive modules may be simpler to analyze, yet will guarantee the same properties as the stated variants. Second, it should be noted that it is straightforward to derive clocks of even higher frequency from the FATAL+ clocks. This is essentially done by frequency multiplication, at the expense of increasing the clock skew. We refer to Dolev et al. [13] for details.", "S0022000014000026-7850": "We next introduce the basic modules that are assumed by the model used in [13]. We first give an intuitive description of the required modules. Subsequently, we introduce a novel formal framework for specifying self-stabilizing fault-tolerant modules and specify our basic modules in this framework. Any implementation satisfying this specification can be plugged into the high-level algorithm in order to yield a system guaranteeing the properties proved in [13].", "S0022399913003358-1044": "Self-reported hearing difficulty was the strongest association with tinnitus. Previous research has shown that around 40% of 55\u201374 year olds with hearing difficulties also report tinnitus [36], and the majority of tinnitus patients have some degree of hearing loss [37]. No single theory explaining the cause of tinnitus is universally accepted, but one theory suggests that tinnitus may result from an increase of central gain (to compensate for deprived sensory inputs) which amplifies neural noise in order to maintain neural homeostasis [38]. It is likely that the severity of tinnitus is influenced by a complex interaction involving auditory, psychological and emotional networks [39,40]. It is interesting that neuroticism is a strong association with current tinnitus, albeit not as strong as hearing difficulty. Furthermore, of those who have tinnitus, neuroticism has a stronger effect on the perceived severity than hearing difficulty. One explanation could be that those who are more neurotic may think their tinnitus is indicative of a more serious condition and therefore find the tinnitus more bothersome. The finding that personality traits such as neuroticism can contribute to tinnitus awareness and distress is important when considering treatment approaches because personality traits are generally stable over time [41], although the absolute level of personality traits can change [42]. Thus it is possible that psychological interventions may be beneficial for tinnitus patients although the effects may be gradual [11].", "S0022399913003358-931": "Tinnitus is the perception of sounds in the head or ears, usually defined as a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound. Tinnitus can be objective or subjective. Objective tinnitus is caused by sounds generated by an internal biological activity. However, subjective tinnitus is much more common and results from abnormal neural activities which are not formed by sounds [1]. Subjective tinnitus is a common and disturbing phenomenon, with a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 20% [2\u20135] in the general population, and an estimated 10 year incidence rate in adults aged over 48 years of 13% [6]. Approximately 5% of the population is severely affected by their tinnitus [7], for example experiencing sleep disorders, concentration difficulties, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "S0022399913003358-943": "Personality characteristics previously reported to be associated with tinnitus include hysteria and hypochondriasis [9,12], introversion [13], withdrawal [9], and emotional isolation [14]. Additionally, particular cognitive strategies, for example, dysfunctional and catastrophic thoughts can increase patients' emotional distress and perceived tinnitus severity, and are thought to be closely related to personality factors [15]. Neuroticism is expressed as \u201cindividual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions\u201d [16] (p. 301). At one extreme, individuals are characterized by high levels of vulnerability to experience negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and insecurity [17]. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer [18], and an increased likelihood of arthritis, kidney/liver disease, and diabetes in the general population [19]. There is evidence that neurotic traits are stronger in tinnitus patients [20], particularly in those with higher levels of tinnitus annoyance, and recent evidence that neuroticism may predict the development of severe tinnitus in patients already experiencing some tinnitus [21]. In a cross-sectional sample of 530 participants (50% with chronic tinnitus), Bartels and colleagues [22] studied the role of type D personality (the tendency towards negative affectivity and social inhibition) on health-related quality of life and self-reported tinnitus-related distress. Tinnitus patients with type D personality reported greater tinnitus-related distress and poorer health-related quality of life compared to those with other personality types. The authors concluded that some personality characteristics are associated with having tinnitus and are likely to contribute to its perceived severity.", "S0022399913003358-956": "UK prevalence estimates for tinnitus are relatively dated; data for the widely cited National Study of Hearing (NSH) [2] were collected in the 1980's.

In order to assess whether clay mineralogy relates to provenance in this setting we compared the smectite/(chlorite + illite), smectite/kaolinite and kaolinite/illite with the neodymium isotope characteristics of the sediments because this isotope system is widely accepted as a reliable provenance proxy that is not affected significantly by chemical weathering (Goldstein et al., 1984) (Fig. 10).

In both offshore cores less negative \u03b5Nd (i.e., less continental, less Himalayan) is often, but not always, associated with higher smectite/(chlorite + illite) ratios.

Since the premise of the investigation was to quantify the relationship between biological richness and soil structural changes over time, the soils were not pre-incubated prior to the start of the experiment. Therefore, microbial communities were allowed to develop during the course of the 7 month experiment either in the presence of mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots, or in unplanted soil, thereby allowing root associated changes in community development to be measured. Others, for example Griffiths et al. (2001) and Wertz et al.

In the mycorrhizal soils, aggregate water repellency was also negatively correlated with bacterial (and fungal) TRF richness but positively correlated with root size and microbial biomass-C. It is likely that mycorrhizal hyphae contributed to the microbial biomass-C measured here which might explain why microbial biomass-C was not a factor in the model explaining repellency in the NM soils. In the mycorrhizal soils the relationship between microbial biomass-C and aggregate stability was negative, whilst it was positive for repellency. The GLM regressions used data for all 7 months but the system was dynamic across the months. For example, aggregate stability was greater in the mycorrhizal soils in month 3, yet repellency increased in months 5 and 7. The positive relationship observed between per cent root length colonised and microbial biomass-C is likely to be the result of increasing hyphal length in the soil, or possibly an enhancement of other microbial species too, since internal AMF root colonisation may not reflect the extraradical hyphal biomass. Aggregate turnover rates range from 4 to 88 days (De Gryze et al. 2005, 2006); an increase in aggregate stability observed here over a 60 day period (from the first to third month harvest) and an increase in aggregate water repellency over a 120 day period (from the first to fifth month harvest) is comparable to that observed by others.", "S0031405612000728-769": "Principal component analysis of fungal TRFs for (A) all seven months combined and (B) for month 7 only.", "S0032063312000487-1141": "We initially made the assumption that all crossing normals were related to wave activity, even those not part of a clear oscillation.

The dawn\u2013dusk asymmetry below 400 km was largely attributed to photoionisation as plasma in the post-noon sector had been exposed to sunlight for longer than plasma in the pre-noon sector. The plasma flow from the dayside to the nightside was driven by the day-to-night pressure gradient, with the higher plasma densities in the post-noon sector enhancing the nightward transport of ions on the dusk side. The super-rotation of the neutral atmosphere also enhanced the ion flow on the dusk side and reduced the flow on the dawn side due to collisional interactions between the ions and the neutral species. A subsequent modelling study at the altitude of the peak density in the ionosphere (\u223c140 km) showed that differences in the thermospheric composition between the dawn and dusk sides may also cause asymmetries in the ionosphere at these altitudes due to changes in the dominant chemical reactions (Fox and Kasprzak, 2007).", "S0032063312002437-593": "Between August 2008 and October 2009 Venus Express (VEX) was in an orbit with periapsis near 86\u00b0N and an altitude between 185 km and 215 km with about 10 min spent in the ionosphere during each orbit.

(2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).", "S0032063313003218-5381": "Thermospheric response time: The thermosphere and magnetosphere are coupled together via ion-neutral collisions in the ionosphere; therefore a change in plasma angular velocity would cause a corresponding change in the thermosphere's effective angular velocity. Recent models for the thermospheric response are generally divided in two scenarios: (i) a system where the thermosphere responds promptly, on the order of a few tens of minutes as found by Millward et al. (2005), and (ii) a system where the thermosphere responds on the order of 2 days and, as such, is essentially unresponsive to transient events (Gong, 2005). However, in this study, we do not make a distinction between thermospheric response models. We simply allow the GCM to respond self-consistently to the imposed changes in plasma angular velocity assumed for the transient compressions and expansions, thus allowing a realistic, thermospheric response to these changes.", "S0032063313003218-6078": "In this section we present findings for our transient magnetospheric compression scenario which lasts for a total of 3 h.", "S0032063313003218-6651": "We interpret our FAC density profiles by considering the corresponding precipitating electron energy fluxes, as shown in Fig. 6(b).

Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm\u22122) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm\u22122) due to \u03a9T(ES)>\u03a9T(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF.

Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7\u00d7 that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of \u2018magnetospheric\u2019 power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount.

A transient compression event consists of an initially expanded, steady-state magnetospheric configuration.

They are known for their excellent engineering properties, such as high modulus, low creep, high strength, and good thermal and dimensional stabilities. However, epoxy polymers have inherently low toughness and impact resistance due to their highly crosslinked structure. This structure leads to brittle behaviour and causes the polymers to suffer from relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. To improve the toughness of epoxy polymers, it has been established that the incorporation of a second micro-phase of a dispersed rubber, e.g. Refs. [1\u20135], or a thermoplastic polymer, e.g. Ref. [6\u20138], can increase the toughness. Here the rubber or thermoplastic particles are typically about 0.1\u20135 \u03bcm in diameter with a volume fraction of about 5\u201320%. The particles are typically well-dispersed, and formed by reaction-induced phase-separation.

The addition of S-CSR particles reduces the compressive true yield stress, as expected, due to the relative softness of the polysiloxane rubber. The values decreased approximately linearly with increasing S-CSR particle content, see Fig. 4. At 20 \u00b0C, a value of 111 MPa was measured for the unmodified epoxy polymer, which also reveals that the unmodified epoxy should have the highest strength, if the effect of defects is excluded, when the test is conducted in uniaxial tension. The lowest value of the compressive true yield stress was measured to be 63 MPa for the 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymer.", "S0032386113005454-2865": "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 \u03bcm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 \u03bcm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at \u2212109 \u00b0C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.", "S0032386113005454-2876": "Shear-band yielding has previously been reported for the present epoxy-polymer formulation when particle modified [33], and was observed during the present plane\u2013strain compression tests. The DN-4PB tests of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers were performed to investigate the process further. After fracture at 20 \u00b0C, the plastic zone at the tip of the sub-critically loaded crack was sectioned and observed using transmission optical microscopy. This showed that a large feather-like deformation zone was formed, see Fig. 16. This feather-like zone comprises highly plastically dilated cavities and localised shear-bands [12,48]. Transmission optical micrographs of the subsurface damage zone of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers tested at different temperatures revealed that the size of the subsurface damage zone decreased as the test temperature decreased, see Fig. 17. This reduction in the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip is due to the increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer at low temperatures.", "S0032386113005454-2886": "The toughening events of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers can be summarised as localised shear-banding of the epoxy polymer initiated by the particles and internal cavitation of the S-CSR particles (which relieves the triaxial stress-state in the vicinity of the crack tip) followed by void growth. These events contribute to the relatively high toughness measured from the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers. The differences observed at low temperatures indicate that the increase of the cavitational resistance of the S-CSR particles delays the cavitation process and enhances the localised shear-band yielding process. The increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer attenuates the deformation of the polymer and reduces the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip, but this effect is compensated for by the increased energy absorption from the enhanced shear-band yielding. Hence, there is a reduction of the toughening performance of the S-CSR particles at low temperatures, but the competition between these effects results in the fracture energy being independent of the test temperature between \u221255 \u00b0C and \u2212109 \u00b0C.", "S0032386113009889-2123": "An energy-based criterion was used to predict debonding of the particles. The method used has been fully described elsewhere [49] and essentially it proposes that the criterion for debonding is based upon the energy released by the debonding process. To obtain the parameters needed for this energy-based criterion, a finite-element analysis modelling study has been used to derive the change in strain-energy arising from the cavitation process, with the addition of the strain-energy stored in the particle prior to debonding. The applied stress used for these simulations was derived from experimental observations. Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size. It has therefore been assumed that the debonding takes place at an applied uniaxial stress of about 70 MPa, which equates to a hydrostatic stress at the crack tip of about 210 MPa. Thus, the finite-element analysis simulations were analysed for an applied hydrostatic stress of 210 MPa.", "S0038071711004354-1624": "In order to test the operation of the dual-chambers, measurements were made in a glasshouse using a mesocosm of 150 cm long, 100 cm wide, filled with a soil depth of 15 cm.

(2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species. Work by Giovannetti et al. (2001, 2004) demonstrated that AMF hyphae frequently anastamose and could result in a large network of interconnecting hyphae. Within the current experiment, colonisation by G. mosseae resulted in a higher proportion of small soil pores to large ones and reduced distances between neighbouring pores. A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (\u223c0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001). In contrast, G. intraradices led to soil with a greater number of large pores and all combinations of G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between neighbouring pores. Bearden (2001) concluded, in a study of soil\u2013water characteristics, that AMF hyphae resulted in soils gaining groups of small pores which corroborates the current findings, although it is interesting that different Glomus species affect the size and distance between pores differently. Bearden (2001) used a combination of six Glomus species (including G. mosseae) in her investigation of vertisols. In contrast, Milleret et al. (2009) found no evidence of G. intraradices forming small diameter structural pores and the larger size of the pores relative to the AMF led them to conclude that pore development was an indirect effect of the mycorrhiza. Since the extraradical hyphae had a smaller diameter than the pores, the authors suggested that hyphal penetration of pores induced root exudation and increased microbial activity. The data in the current investigation show that plant roots, possibly by influencing the associated microbial biomass and not colonisation by AMF per se, positively affected aggregate stability. Previous studies (e.g. Bedini et al., 2009) showed that aggregate stability is affected by the plant-fungal system rather than by plant root metabolism. Hallett et al. (2009) performed an elegant experiment in which mycorrhizal-deficient and \u2018wild type\u2019 tomato plants were grown in an agricultural field soil amended with G. mosseae and G. intraradices. These authors demonstrated that aggregate stability and porosity were increased in planted soils irrespective of the plant type (and mycorrhizal status) and they conclude that roots drive the stabilisation of soil structure. Their experiment lasted for 84 days and during this time the soil experienced wet\u2013dry cycles which may have encouraged microbial populations to produce polysaccharides which in turn enhanced aggregate production. However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability. Whilst it has been shown before that different AMF species may affect aggregate stability (Schreiner et al., 1997), the focus here is on the effects of the mycelium in addition to the mycorrhiza. No correlations were observed for AMF hyphal abundance and soil physical properties, demonstrating that the differences observed may relate to growth patterns and mycelium architecture rather than density, or perhaps to AMF-specific altered C-exudation since AM fungi are known to produce extracellular soil proteins such as glomalin (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996). The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.", "S0038071712001010-918": "AM fungal inoculum as a single factor was significant (P < 0.001) with distinct species combinations resulting in different levels of root colonisation.

The SCGs show that from the initial version barcode-0.90 there were two coherent clusters in the system. The smaller one is around 10% of the code while the larger is around 40% of the code. As the system evolved and went through various modifications and enhancements, the number of clusters and the profile of the clusters remained consistent other than its scaled growth with the increase in program size. It is also evident that during evolution of the system, the enhancement code or newly added code formed part of the larger cluster. This is why in the later stages of the evolution we see an increase in the size of the largest cluster, but not the smaller one.", "S016412121300188X-5038": "As an answer to RQ7, this study finds that unless there is significant refactoring of the system, coherent cluster profiles remain stable during system evolution and thus captures the core architecture of the program in all three case studies.

Previous work established the existence of coherent dependence clusters and detailed the functionalities of the visualization tool. This paper extends previous work in many ways, firstly by introducing an efficient hashing algorithm for slice approximation. This improves on the precision of previous slice approximation from 78% to 95%, resulting in precise and accurate clustering. The coherent cluster existence study is extended to empirically validate the results by considering 30 production programs. Additional case studies show that coherent clusters can help reveal the structure of a program and identify structural defects. We also introduce the notion of inter-cluster dependence which will form the base of reverse engineering efforts in future. Finally, we also present studies which show the lack of correlation between coherent clusters and bug fixes and show that coherent clusters remain surprisingly stable during system evolution.", "S0164121213002641-2930": "Definition 1[Projection] Given a subset of variables V \u2286 Var, we define the projection of a state \u03c3 onto V as the function \u03c1V(\u03c3):V\u2192A\u222aS such that \u2200v\u2208V.\u03c1V(\u03c3)(v)=\u03c3(v).

However, rather than focusing just on those three bacteria, this study cultured effusions on a wide range of different media for prolonged time periods in order to capture as many isolates as possible. Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp. and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study. CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43]. S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45]. Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47].

In addition to tissue surfaces, biofilms have also been identified attached to mucus [21,22] and attach in vitro to collagen gel matrix [23].

The presence of carbon observed by XPS at the surface of the HA nanoparticles might result from atmospheric contamination by CO2 and volatile fatty acids.

This would explain the higher proportion of carbon when compared to the native HA nanopowder and why the ratio of oxygen to carbon is lower. The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature.

Eucalypts over-expressing a sequence-enhanced version of cry3Aa produced leaves that were toxic to three beetle species [166].", "S0168945213001805-5396": "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called \u2018age-age\u2019 correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula \u00d7 alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula \u00d7 alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable\u2014in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.", "S0169433213008933-689": "To increase reflectance of the HSQ film and to avoid light transmission and reflection from the metal substrate, we sputter coated cured HSQ samples with a thin film of gold/palladium (80/20) alloy.

The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f.

However, lakes are especially prone to a reservoir effect, due to dissolution of ancient carbonates and/or old organic matter that is washed into the lake from the catchment and incorporated into the sediment. Both phenomena can result in anomalous 14C ages and an offset from the real age of the dated material, which is not necessarily constant through time in the sediment section (Geyh et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2007). This offset from the real age can be of the order of several hundred or even more than a thousand years if bulk sediment or carbonates are dated, and can thus lead to misleading or erroneous age models if it is not taken into account (Geyh et al., 1998; Bertrand et al., 2012). Sediment sections spanning time intervals with multiple tephra layers could therefore easily be miscorrelated if the tephra is not adequately characterised to back up correlations. Appropriate tephra characterisation can potentially also help in evaluating the reservoir effect in a sediment section by providing a tie-point in the age model, provided the age of the tephra is well known from one or more independent sources (e.g., 14C dating on charcoal incorporated in terrestrial deposits, for example the well-constrained 3.00\u20133.05 ka cal BP Alpehu\u00e9 Pumice (So-A) eruption from Sollipulli; Supplementary Table 1; Naranjo et al., 1993b).", "S0301010413004096-646": "Metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials show promise for H2 storage and it is widely predicted by computational modelling that MOFs incorporating ultra-micropores are optimal for H2 binding due to enhanced overlapping potentials. We report the investigation using inelastic neutron scattering of the interaction of H2 in an ultra-microporous MOF material showing low H2 uptake capacity. The study has revealed that adsorbed H2 at 5 K has a liquid recoil motion along the channel with very little interaction with the MOF host, consistent with the observed low uptake. The low H2 uptake is not due to incomplete activation or decomposition as the desolvated MOF shows CO2 uptake with a measured pore volume close to that of the single crystal pore volume. This study represents a unique example of surprisingly low H2 uptake within a MOF material, and complements the wide range of studies on systems showing higher uptake capacities and binding interactions.", "S0301010413004096-693": "Metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) complexes are a sub-class of porous solids which show great promise for gas storage and separation due to their high surface area, low framework density, and tuneable functional pore environment [3]. MOF materials are usually built up from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers to afford 3D extended frameworks with the formation of cavities ranging from microporous to mesoporous region. Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77 K) [4] with a record of \u223c16 wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6]. However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material. There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use. In situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at below 10 K has been used previously to determine the locations of D2 within a few best-behaving MOF materials incorporating exposed metal sites [7\u201312]. It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state. These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities. Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study. Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.", "S0301010413004096-767": "INS spectra were recorded on the TOSCA spectrometer at the ISIS Neutron Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK) for energy transfers between \u223c\u22122 and 500 meV.

Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000 stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations.

Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height \u2a7d50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil\u2013water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.", "S0378112713005288-1916": "Regeneration density against distance from seed source is plotted in Fig. 2. In general, birch showed a broad shoulder of dense regeneration close to source, followed by a very rapid decline and then a long tail consisting of a slow decline.

No significant correlation between distance from seed source (for distances up to 100 m from the source) and regeneration density was seen for animal-dispersed species (oak and rowan).

The distribution of regenerating saplings will therefore be partly controlled by the behaviour of the dispersing animal.

However, our findings are in contrast to previous work carried out in lowland sites in the UK that found positive relationships between the number of oak seedlings and distance to parent trees but no significant effect for birch seedlings (Harmer et al., 2005), possibly indicating differences between the shelterwood examined by Harmer et al.

Furthermore, previous studies have found that where grazing pressure is high, brash (Truscott et al., 2004) and coarse woody debris (Smit et al., 2012) can help protect seedlings from browsing. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from our study as only a single site (U15) recorded significant browsing.

The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method.

This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach.

At the initial stages of infiltration, when the height of surface water is much greater than the penetration depth, hydraulic gradients are expected to be higher than later on. Furthermore, when the penetration depth is small the experimental error in evaluating gradients is large. For these reasons the discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is probably due to experimental error.", "S0378383912000130-3745": "For the 8.5 mm beach the modelling produces a reasonably accurate trend at x = 1980 mm, while at x = 2780 mm the model fails to predict the initial sharp rise and the decline at the later stages of the swash.

The numerical predictions of the pore-air pressure build-up within the two sediments are in good agreement with the large-scale laboratory measurements. The time when pressure first changes (i.e. the arrival of the pressure front) is well-predicted across the swash zone, as are the magnitudes of pressure head during uprush and backwash. The numerical model captures well the groundwater response to surface\u2013subsurface water exchange, with reasonable agreement between the model-predicted and measured exit point during the backwash.

OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39\u201341].", "S0925443913001385-1429": "Human skin fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 \u03bcg/ml uridine, 110 \u03bcg/ml pyruvate, 10,000 U/ml penicillin G and 10,000 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin.", "S0925443913001385-1526": "RNA was isolated from fibroblasts using Trizol following manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) (107 to end in Escherichia coli) is conserved in evolution [50] and is required for initial binding and GTPase activation for both EF-Tu and EF-G. Indeed, both EF-Tu and EF-G have greatly diminished GTPase activity on ribosomes lacking the CTD of L12 [51,52]. Superimposition of MRPL12 with the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome (PDB code: 2WRL) lacking L7/L12 stalk proteins shows that MRPL12 Ala181 is located within this highly conserved region (Fig. 3A). Moreover, modeling of MRPL12 shows Ala181 positioned in a helix potentially involved in translation factor interactions (Fig. 3A/B). Bacterial L7/L12 CTDs also contain a number of strictly conserved residues that are involved in the initial contact with elongation factors [52,53] and crucial for translation [54]. Alanine is one of the best helix forming residues and substitutions can therefore have profound energetic effects by perturbing packing interactions or tertiary contacts [55]. Thus, the p.Ala181Val change might be predicted to alter interactions with the elongation factors, and since MRPL7/12 bound to elongation factors is predicted to have a higher affinity for the ribosome [54], the mutation may in turn affect both rate and accuracy of mitochondrial translation.", "S0925443913001385-1638": "The steady state level of MRPL12 in the subject's fibroblasts was reduced to 30% of control value (Fig. 4A and B). The mt-LSU protein ICT1 was also decreased (~ 30% of control values) as was MRPL3 (by 37%) suggesting that a consequence of the MRPL12 mutation is a global defect in assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU). In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60\u201380% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.", "S0925443913001385-1646": "In order to determine whether the MRPL12 mutation also induced changes in composition and assembly of the mitochondrial ribosomal large and small subunits, mitochondrial lysates from cultured fibroblasts (subject and control) were fractionated on isokinetic sucrose gradients (10\u201330%, as in Ref. [47]). If assembly of either the large subunit or the entire ribosome was affected then the distribution of individual ribosomal proteins would change within the gradient profile. On analysis MRPL12 from the patient was substantially decreased in all fractions but detectable in the fractions consistent with mt-LSU; however it was noticeably absent from the free pool (fractions 1 and 2, Fig. 5). This was in contrast to the control that exhibited a pool of free MRPL12, which has been reported to interact with POLRMT [56]. MRPL3 was also slightly reduced in subject cells but remained in fractions consistent with the large subunit. The MRPL12 mutation impacted more modestly on the small ribosomal subunit, with DAP3 apparently unaffected and MRPS18B found in lower amounts only in fractions 4 and 5 but otherwise with similar steady state levels and distribution profile compared to control. Since POLRMT and MRPL12 have been published as interactors, we analyzed both the steady state level and gradient distribution of POLRMT to see if these were affected by the MRPL12 mutation. Overall levels in the subject sample were decreased to 63% of control value (Fig. 5B) but distribution in the gradient appeared largely unaffected with the exception of fraction 11, where levels were lower than control (Fig. 5A bottom panels).", "S0925443913001385-1683": "MRPL12 is the orthologue of eubacterial L7/L12, where L7 is identical to L12 except that it is N-terminal acetylated. L7/L12 is also phosphorylated, which can affect both conformation and binding to partner ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Ref. [37]). This modification has now been confirmed to be present in mammalian MRPL12 [59]. In eubacteria, association of L7/12 to the large subunit takes place via the L10 protein such that two L7/L12 heterodimers normally associate per LSU [60]. Interestingly these dimers are actively exchanged on the 70S molecule without disruption of the ribosomal particle [54,61]. The dimerization status and number of dimers attached to the human 55S has not been clarified. In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate demonstrated similar levels small subunit polypeptides including DAP3 and MRPS18B in subject and control samples. In contrast, the total amount of MRPL12 was reduced (Fig. 7B). In the patient the IP is restricted to MRPL12 in the large subunit or the fully assembled 55S with the total amount of MRPL12 being reduced as it lacks the \u201cfree\u201d population. The densitometric measurements indicate that the patient IP has ~ 49% MRPL12 compared to control, in accordance with the gradient and steady state data. ICT1 appears to be sensitive to the MRPL12 levels and so is reduced in both the IP (~ 58% of control) and in the steady state westerns (Fig. 4). The lower levels of MRPL12 could reflect loss of multimerization but since the region in the bacterial protein involved in multimerization is towards the N-terminus [62], this mutation is unlikely to have an impact on dimer/multimer formation. The translation factor bound dimer has been suggested to have an increased affinity for the ribosome [54,61]. Thus a possible explanation is that the mutation affects translation factor binding, thereby reducing the affinity of the mutant MRPL12 for the ribosome. If this were the case, however, then we would expect an increase in the pool of free MRPL12 whereas the subject exhibits a reduced pool of free MRPL12, which interacts with POLRMT [57]. The immunoprecipitation was performed using an MRPL12 specific antibody and so should contain all free MRPL12, MRPL12 associated with uncomplexed mt-LSU and MRPL12 as part of the fully assembled 55S. Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components. Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.", "S0925443913001385-839": "Mitochondrial protein synthesis.

A series of initial experiments indicated that BHJ with 80 vol% of C60 and a thickness of 70 nm lead to device characteristics comparable to the previously reported planar heterojunction devices (Jsc\u223c2\u20133 mA/cm2 and Voc\u223c0.40\u20130.45 V) [37].

We showed that co-deposition of blended mixtures leads to 60% higher photocurrents than in thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts [37]. Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ we improved their power conversion efficiency by as much as 80%, achieving performance comparable to PTh:PCBM equivalents processed in solution from thermo-cleavable precursors [52]. An enhanced photoresponse results from the favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing, modestly larger grain sizes and increased crystallization of C60. In contrast to most small-molecule blends, annealing-induced phase separation does not lead to formation of microcrystals but rather to a controlled improvement of the donor\u2013acceptor network.

The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2\u20137% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10\u201315%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost.

This is called peak-power, denoted as Wp. STC represent rather favourable operating conditions for most PV technologies as it is an unrealistic combination of a cold module temperature (25 \u00b0C) at a high irradiance (1000 W/m2). Different modules, even of the same technology, generally have different rated powers and the energy yields must be made comparable in any inter-comparison study. This is achieved by using the specific yield (kWh/kWp). The specific yield is a key property of PV modules at a particular location and can be a major sales argument for competing PV module suppliers.", "S0927024813002961-1322": "It has been pointed out in the previous section that the spectrum can have a significant influence for amorphous silicon devices. The behaviour of devices will depend on the band gap of the absorber material and potentially on the window layer, where this is present. It is apparent from Fig. 7 that there is only a small spectral dependence for c-Si and CIGS devices. The absolute level depends on the normalisation, but in terms of relative changes in the generated short-circuit current, the effect accounts for about \u00b13% for CIGS and c-Si and +10% to \u221220% for a-Si devices. The overall impact on annual energy yield is slightly positive for a-Si devices and virtually zero for the other technologies.", "S0927024813002961-1334": "There are several time-scales involved in performance variations of photovoltaic devices. In the short term, there is the direct influence of the environment as discussed in Section 4. In the mid-term there is the Staebler\u2013Wronski effect for a-Si [48,49] or pre-conditioning for CIGS, which affects the annual energy prediction by less than 5% typically and are not further explored here. The effect for CIGS is slightly contradictory as there is no clarity of the time scales involved yet [4,50]. There are also long-term gradual degradation effects which affect all device technologies [51]. In many published discussions there are generalisations of technologies. It is shown below that such a general behaviour was not observed at CREST. The maximum power point data of all devices within an irradiance range of 650\u2013750 W/m2 have been extracted and corrected to 700 W/m2 and 25 \u00b0C using bi-linear interpolation. These power values are annotated as P700. This particular irradiance level was chosen as there is a statistically significant number of data points in each month of the year and thus fewer outliers to affect the analysis.

This means that the absolute degradation rate might be marginally affected by the initial SWE and a slightly lower rate might be observed over a longer period. The degradation of the devices is, however, higher than the rest as apparent from Fig. 10.

However, some samples were intentionally subsequently contaminated with iron, using the same procedure as in Refs. [23,34,35]. This involved rubbing the back-side of the sample with iron pieces (99.95% purity from Testbourne Limited, UK). Samples were then annealed in air in a pre-heated furnace at temperatures up to 798 \u00b0C for times chosen to ensure complete iron diffusion through the sample. Although our intention was to contaminate samples only with iron, the possibility that other transition metal impurities have entered the samples cannot be completely ruled out. Cooling was rapid, with the samples removed from the furnace at temperature and placed on a heat sink. It is estimated that samples were cooled to below \u223c100 \u00b0C in <10 s. Samples which were not intentionally contaminated with iron are referred to as \u201cuncontaminated\u201d samples in this paper, although it is possible that the low levels of impurity contamination in such samples have significant effects, as discussed later.", "S0927024813003036-2011": "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm\u22123 to 1016 cm\u22123. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron\u2013oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 \u00b0C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to \u223c50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron\u2013boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron\u2013oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0.

This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV\u2013vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g\u22121) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g\u22121), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5\u201340 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid.

It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase. CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or \u201cseeds\u201d (as indicated from XRD data). As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase. As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase. This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.", "S0950705113001895-23137": "Assume the object x11 in Table 4 inserts into Table 2, and U\u2032 = U \u222a {x11}.

In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies.

One observed issue with the separate topology is that the turbines in front easily get high rotational velocities for the peak wind speeds. It is shown in Ref.

For rapid decreases in wind speed, the existing wake causes an additional drop in wind speed. Hence the rotational velocity and the extracted power drop below the steady state value before the wake has drifted away. For the square configuration, a rapid increase in wind speed causes the front turbine to obtain a high rotational velocity, which generates a large wake behind the turbine. This large wake will drift into the downwind turbine, hence reducing the rotational velocity of the second turbine.

Consequently, soil P recommendation systems are widely used around the world to ensure good soil management and nutrient efficiency promoting agricultural sustainability. However recommendation systems differ considerably among countries. Not many systems can be found as peer reviewed literature; however a brief overview on those available is hereby given. Phosphorus recommendation systems are commonly used in Brazil, in a country where soils are generally nutrient poor. The Brazilian recommendation systems are based on quantitative analyses of soil input variables. The input variable consists of the following factors; cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), base sum, exchangeable aluminium (Al), calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg), potassium (K) and P levels, sodium (Na) saturation and electrical conductivity. The output variable of the system is the amount of fertilizer to be applied. This is mainly based on 4 classes, low, medium, high to very high (Palhares et al., 2001). While Brazil follows a detailed set of variables when recommending P fertilizer levels, the agronomists at Kansas University \u2013 who, among other land grant Universities in the United States, provide single rate recommendation for nutrients such as P \u2013 are developing a fertilizer recommendation system that gives growers the flexibility to choose a soil management practice suitable for their needs. This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the \u201cnutrient sufficiency recommendation system\u201d which is developed to provide a 90\u201395% maximum yield for the year, and the \u201cbuild maintenance fertility program\u201d based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4\u20138 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003). In West Africa, a framework to optimize soil fertility management in rice production is in use were the yield potential is estimated by an ecophysiological model based on weather conditions, cultivar species and sowing date. This yield potential is used as an input into a static model together with field specific data such as recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous NPK supply and maximum NPK accumulation.

However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 \u00b0C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; W\u00fcrdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 \u00b0C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth.

There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (M\u00f6ller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 \u00b0C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 \u00b0C) (Fig. 3).", "S175058361300203X-1280": "Input to the modeling consisted of the compressional wave velocity (Vp), shear wave velocity (Vs), and density (\u03c1) near the injection well obtained from borehole logging data (Fig. 4).

(2010) performed simulations on multiple realizations of the Ketzin reservoir using a stochastic Monte Carlo approach in order to take into account the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir characterization at the scale required for fluid flow simulations. In this paper, we use a similar approach, but this time to investigate the impact of the reservoir temperature on the fluid migration and, in turn, on the 4D seismic data. Hydrogeological studies at the Ketzin site (Norden et al., 2010) have shown that a 2D radially symmetric model of the upper part (33 m) of the Stuttgart Formation can be used to interpret the 3D data acquired near the injection well (Fig. 7). This model accounts for the presence of channel sandstones in the reservoir that are the most favorable for CO2 migration and contains effective porosities in the range of 20\u201325% (F\u00f6rster et al., 2010). As known from core and log analysis of the injection well Ktzi201/2007 and the first observation well Ktzi200/2007, the reservoir is composed of two high porosity sandstone layers. These layers are separated by a thin strongly cemented sandstone layer (Norden et al., 2010). Since the thickness of this layer is in the decimeter range, it cannot be detected with the seismic wavelengths typically available from surface-seismic measurements. However, this layer is known to be a significant constraint to fluid migration due to its low permeability (Wiese et al., 2010).", "S175058361300203X-1542": "It is well known that the seismic velocity in sandstones saturated with brine does not depend on temperatures in the range of 34\u201338 \u00b0C (e.g. Mavko, 2005).

The resulting difference between the scenarios in Vp is less than 5 m/s.

(2012). However, obvious disagreements are found at the Ktzi202/2007 well, which may be due to the fact that the velocity model used at this location is not sufficiently correct. Seismic amplitude differences between the 38 \u00b0C and 34 \u00b0C scenarios correspond to less than 1% of the amplitude values of the baseline (Fig. 8). Since the normalized root mean square (NRMS) differences in the 3D time-lapse data are greater than 10% (Kashubin et al., 2011) these temperature effects in the reservoir will not be resolvable with surface seismic methods at the Ketzin site.", "S175058361300203X-1638": "By integrating seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations, we have estimated the impact of the reservoir temperature on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin.

Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 \u00b0C and 38 \u00b0C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).", "S1750583613004192-1126": "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.", "S1750583613004192-1267": "An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.", "S1750583613004192-1689": "The modeled low shale barrier threshold pressures are potentially indicative of fracturing. However, the current pressure regime is extremely unlikely to cause fracturing, and so it is inferred that the shales may have been pervasively fractured in the past. A fracturing process consistent with the geological history of the region is that the shale barriers have undergone a transient pulse of fluid overpressure sufficient to fracture the rock. Such a pressure history could be a consequence of the rapid unloading of hundreds of meters of ice from the overburden during a deglaciation. A transient ice sheet load equivalent to 10 MPa of overpressure could have been removed rapidly by melting, or instantly by a sea level rise and the flotation of an ice sheet grounded on the seabed, during a typical ablation timespan of less than a few thousand years. At the shallow burial depth of these shales, 10 MPa is sufficient to exceed the tensional rock strength and cause pervasive hydraulic fracturing. This may have happened as a consequence of one or more regional ice sheet excursions into the basin. While the strength and thickness of the overburden at any given ice collapse is unknown, a conservative approximation for the fracture gradient, based on present-day leak-off tests (Nicoll, 2012), suggests that such an event is plausible.", "S1750583613004192-714": "The Sleipner plume profile, viewed from the southeast, circa July 2002.

In contrast, undifferentiated hiPSCs on day 0 showed negative staining of all germ markers (data not shown). For in vivo assay, BC1 and TNC1 harvested from suspension culture in spinner flasks were injected into immune-deficient mice and were able to form teratomas containing cells of all germ layers, including glandular epithelium, chondrocytes, and neural rosettes (Fig. 5b). Directed hematopoietic differentiation potential was also tested as previously described (Fig. 5c). Differentiating BC1 and TNC1 cells contained 43.57% \u00b1 4.35% (n = 3) and 43.22% \u00b1 7.13% (n = 3) CD34+CD45+ HPCs on day 14 of differentiation, respectively. The CFU assay measuring hematopoietic progenitors showed that hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks were able to generate colonies of different hematopoietic cell lineages.

However, there is no evidence that it should be attributed to the suspension culture. In general, recently improved iPSC culture conditions reduce selective pressure for the growth of mutated cells that acquire growth advantages.

Hence, GFP+ human trigeminal neuron clusters were injected into adult NOD/SCID mice via stereotactic surgery (see Experimental Procedures). Histological analysis 4 weeks after transplantation showed survival of GFP+ human cell graft in the ventral pons (Figure S5E). Although GFP+ cell bodies remained tightly clustered at injection site, GFP+ fibers showed extensive projections into the host brain (n = 6) including the endogenous trigeminal nuclei (Figure S5F).

The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly.

Inspecting the most important features that differentiate children born with hearing impairment from children with normal hearing in this study, we see some features that are in line with hypotheses about under stimulation of auditory function in HI infants; while other observations already begin to add to our knowledge of how congenital deafness affects brain development and function. For example, features B, F, H, and I include known components of the auditory language network which our group and others have previously shown to be engaged by the narrative comprehension task (Karunanayaka et al., 2007; Schmithorst et al., 2006). These features include (B) the planum temporale and primary auditory cortex in the left hemisphere (including Wernicke's area, the classical language recognition module), as well as the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus at the temporal parietal junction of the (F) left and (H, I) right hemispheres, known auditory and visual language association regions. Although all participants were bilaterally severely to profoundly hearing impaired, we observe left dominant auditory/language related activity present in components A, B, and F. In addition, components H and I contain right hemisphere auditory/language activity. Functional features such as these are not unexpected in terms of regions of differential cortical activation between HI and NH children listening to natural language as an auditory stimulus and it is reassuring to see these regions highlighted by our algorithm as potential biomarkers corresponding to hearing impairment. Similarly, there is evidence of differential activation in subcortical features corresponding to the auditory brainstem pathways. Features A, D, and J include elements of the reticular auditory pathway of the brainstem which has been identified by electrophysiological studies to have a key role in auditory perception of location of sounds as well as the ability to filter a source of sound in background noise. Roughly these features appear to encompass key elements of the auditory pathway at the level of the pons (D) including the cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, lateral lemniscus and superior olive on the right, (A) inferior colliculus, medial geniculate on the left and (J) thalamus bilaterally (Kretschmann and Weinrich, 1998).

For the other two animals (Nos. 6 and 8), we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with nonintegrating episomal vectors (Okita et al., 2013). We selected the best clone from each animal according to the following criteria: a stable embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like morphology of the colonies after passaging, expression of pluripotent markers, few or no integrated transgenes (Figures 1A\u20131F; Figure S1 available online), and the potential for stable neural differentiation. A PCR analysis revealed that all of the clones with retroviral vectors showed apparent expression of remaining transgenes (Figures S1C and S1D), whereas the clones with episomal vectors never did (Figure S1F). To detect the iPSC-derived cells in a brain, we introduced GFP (Figures 1G and 1H). The selected clones of iPSCs had the potential to generate teratomas in the testes of a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse within 12 weeks (Figures 1I\u20131M).", "S2213671113000738-667": "Next, we investigated the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in iPSC-derived neural cells. Flow cytometry using antibodies against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C revealed that mature neurons on days 35 and 71 expressed only a low level of MHC-I, and that the expression was enhanced in response to interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3: 25 ng/ml for 48 hr; Figure 2A). The expression level of the mRNAs was approximately 1:100 compared with peripheral blood cells in both fibroblast- and blood-cell-derived iPSCs, which was again increased by exposure to IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 2B). These results suggest that donor-derived neurons could express MHC-I when INF-\u03b3 was secreted by the host brain under inflammatory conditions.", "S2213671113000738-684": "In sequential PET studies, we observed increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 in one allograft (animal No. 10) at 3 months (Figures 3A and 3B). We could not detect any apparent uptake in the other animals or at any other time points (Figure S2). Intriguingly, the serum level of IFN-\u03b3 temporarily increased at 2 months after the transplant in three animals (Figure 3C). An immunofluorescence study conducted at 3.5\u20134 months showed that MHC-II+ cells were more frequently found in allografts than in autografts, especially in the monkey with increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 (Figure 3D, No. 10). The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells. An immunofluorescence study revealed that more CD45+ cells (a marker for pan-leukocytes) accumulated in allografts compared with autografts (Figures 3I and 3J). Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L). These findings suggest that an acquired immune response was elicited only in the allografts in the primate brain.", "S2213671113000738-738": "Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-\u03b3, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-\u03b3 increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5\u20134 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-\u03b3 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-\u03b3. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.", "S2213671113000738-787": "For in vivo studies, the fixed frozen brains were sliced at 40 \u03bcm thickness and immunologically stained via the free-floating method.

Cells grown in these culture conditions successively express primitive streak markers (T and Mixl1), downregulate pluripotency markers (NANOG, SOX2, and POU5F1) and progressively upregulate definitive endoderm markers (CXCR4, FOXA2, GATA4, CERB, and SOX17) (Figures S1A\u2013S1C available online). Flow cytometry analyses showed that 80% of the resulting DE population coexpresses CXCR4 and SOX17 (Figure S1D). Interestingly, the resulting population of DE cells is negative for genes marking the foregut (SOX2), the midgut/hindgut (CDX2), the pancreas (PDX1), the liver (AFP), and the lungs (HOXA1) (Figures S1E and S1F) This confirms that DE cells generated in vitro could correspond to early endoderm progenitor cells prior to anteroposterior patterning or organogenesis.", "S2213671113000908-979": "GFP-expressing H9, BBHX8, and A1ATD-1 cells were generated by stable transfection using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (Vallier et al., 2001).

Similar targeting efficiencies in hPSCs using AAV have been reported by others (Asuri et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2010, 2011; Smith-Arica et al., 2003), indicating that AAV offers a highly efficient and robust approach to target genes for HR in hPSCs.", "S2213671113000921-714": "(D) IF analysis of GFP and SOX2 showed colocalization in NPCs (scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm).", "S2213671113000921-756": "(B) IF analysis of day 8 SOX2-GFP AFE cultures (scale bar represents 200 \u03bcm).", "S2213671113000921-994": "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination.

Additional pCK reactivity was seen \u201cunderneath\u201d the cell carrier, likely from host RPE. Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3). Costaining of SC121 with an antibody to MCT1 and Ezrin, both apical membrane markers, further confirmed that the RPE were (still) polarized (Figure 3). SC121+ RPE transplants were negative for the expression of the cell-cycle marker ki67, the proliferation marker phosphohistone H3, and for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (Figures 3F\u20133H), indicating absence of proliferation and apoptosis. We estimated the total human RPE cell survival to be approximately 95% after 1 month by using the SC121 positivity; we measured the total length of the carrier and the length of SC121 stain and calculated the percent coverage of SC121 over the total carrier length.
