Vascular risk was assessed with the Framingham Cardiovascular, Coronary Heart Disease, and Stroke Risk Scores.

       " 'S0006322312001096-1177': 'The Whitehall II study is a prospective cohort study of British civil servants established in 1985 to study associations between risk factors, pathophysiological changes, and clinical disease (22). The target population was all London-based office staff, aged 35 to 55, working in 20 civil service departments on recruitment to the study in 1985 to 1988 (phase 1). With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women). Since the phase 1 medical examination, follow-up examinations have taken place approximately every 5 years: phase 3 (1991 to 1993, n = 8815); phase 5 (1997 to 1999, n = 7870); phase 7 (2003 to 2004, n = 6967); and phase 9 (2008 to 2009, n = 6761). Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here. We use data from three screening cycles: from phase 3 to phase 5, from phase 5 to phase 7, and from phase 7 to phase 9 with phases 3, 5, and 7 providing baseline measures of vascular risk to assess incidence of depressive symptoms at phases 5, 7, and 9 in the three data cycles, respectively.',\n",

Venous blood was taken in the fasting state or at least 5 hours after a light, fat-free breakfast. Serum for lipid analyses was refrigerated at −4°C and assayed within 72 hours. Cholesterol was measured with the use of a Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics System, Nutley, New Jersey). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured by precipitating non-HDL cholesterol with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride using a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant. Participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and new venous blood samples were taken at 2 hours postadministration of a 75 g glucose solution. Blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method on a YSI MODEL 2300 STAT PLUS Analyzer (YSI Corporation, Yellow Springs, Ohio; mean coefficient of variation: 1.4%–3.1%). Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2-hour postload glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L, reported doctor diagnosed diabetes, or use of diabetes medication (24). We measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure twice in the sitting position after 5 minutes rest with a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer (phases 3 and 5) (Lynjay Services Ltd., Worthing, United Kingdom) and OMRON HEM 907 (phase 7) (Omron, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom), the average of two readings used in the analysis. Atrial fibrillation was identified on the Glasgow 12-lead electrocardiogram analysis program combined with manual review (Prof. P. Macfarlane, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom). Limb lead electrocardiograms were classified according to the Minnesota code (25), with tall R waves (codes 3-1 to 3-3) used to reflect left ventricular hypertrophy. Information on smoking and use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering medication was requested at phases 3, 5, and 7.',\n",

First, participants responded to the self-administered 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at phases 3, 5, 7, and 9, a screening instrument designed for and widely used in population-based surveys and trials (26). Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27).

Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54 °N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments. The CIE onset is identified from organic matter δ13C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence. Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass. Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103 yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle. Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM. Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores. This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate. A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.',\n",

It was associated with a substantial injection of δ13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (see Pagani et al., 2006a) over <20 ka (Cui et al., 2011), causing a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) between −2 and −7‰ in marine and terrestrial sediments (see overview in Schouten et al., 2007) lasting 170 ka (Röhl et al., 2007), and a prominent dissolution horizon in the deep sea signifying deep ocean acidification (Kennett and Stott 1991; Zachos et al., 2005). The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).',\n",

Core 22/10a-4 is located in the central part of the basin (Figs. 1 and S1) and is therefore disconnected from many marginal marine processes that could mask oceanographic signals (e.g. tidal or storm-induced erosion and slumping). Paleobathymetry estimates in the North Sea during the Paleocene and Eocene are difficult to constrain accurately, as the extant benthic foraminifera present in the Paleogene are found today living between 200 and >1000 m water depth (Gradstein et al., 1992), and are controlled predominantly by substrate and bottom water properties. However using a number of paleoecologic micropaleontology methods together (Gillmore et al., 2001), along with 2D structural restoration (Kjennerud and Sylta, 2001), broad agreement was found and central parts of the northern North Sea appear to have had paleodepths of >0.5 km in the earliest Eocene near 22/10a-4 (Kjennerud and Gillmore, 2003, Fig. S1).',\n",

The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically <10 cm). Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study. During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100 m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996). This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2). Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996). The CIE at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4. The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009). Therefore, surface water salinity changes in the North Sea Basin provide a sensitive gauge for stratification forced by changes in tectonics and the hydrologic cycle.',\n",

However, the mechanisms responsible for this gradual pCO2 drawdown remain unclear. The biological carbon pump, in particular associated with increased diatom abundance in the Southern Ocean during the late Eocene, represents a potential candidate (Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009; Salamy and Zachos, 1999; Scher and Martin, 2006).',\n",

Spicules were sonicated in reagent grade methanol and dried down in 200 μL of concentrated HNO3.

Our previous Southern Ocean core top study included Antarctic Peninsula sediments containing Chaetoceros sp. and Pacific sector sediments containing F. kerguelensis (Egan et al., 2012). The size fractions analysed had up to 40% differences in the abundance of these diatoms (Fig. 5). However, there is no detectable δ30Si offset between size fractions in the core tops TAN127 or 385 (Fig. 5a and b), whilst in KC08A (Fig. 5c), there is a slight negative offset of the 12–20 μm fraction which is opposite to that expected if the abundance of Chaetoceros was the cause (the suggested larger fractionation would act to lower δ30Si in the smaller size fractions). Rather, the δ30Si values of size fractions between 2 and 20 μm display a good correlation (r2=0.92, Fig. 2a) with surface silicic acid concentration and, where the water source δ30Si and silicic acid concentration are known or can be reasonably estimated, converge on an apparent 30ε of ∼–1‰ (Egan et al., 2012; Fripiat et al., 2011c). This suggests that whilst inter-specific differences in fractionation factor exist in culture, in the natural environment the presence of such species does not yield a large offset in the δ30Si signature of the diatom population as a whole. Although a down core effect cannot be completely ruled out, the good agreement between the 2–10 μm and 10–20 μm size fractions in our record from Site 1090 (Fig. 6) and our previous core top study (Figs. 2 and 5) suggest that changes in the species specific fractionation factor are unlikely to be the dominant driver of Site 1090 diatom δ30Si variation.',\n",

Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.',\n",

A plume of water ice molecules and dust released through geysers on the south polar region provides enough material to feed the E-ring and also the neutral torus of Saturn and the entire magnetosphere. In the time period 2005–2010 the Cassini spacecraft flew close by the moon 14 times, sometimes as low as 25 km above the surface and directly through the plume. For the very first time measurements of plasma and energetic particles inside the plume and its immediate vicinity could be obtained. In this work we summarize the results of energetic electron measurements in the energy range 27 keV to 21 MeV taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of the moon in combination with measurements of the magnetometer instrument MAG and the Electron Spectrometer ELS of the plasma instrument CAPS onboard the spacecraft. Features in the data can be interpreted as that the spacecraft was connected to the plume material along field lines well before entering the high density region of the plume. Sharp absorption signatures as the result of losses of energetic electrons bouncing along those field lines, through the emitted gas and dust clouds, clearly depend on flyby geometry as well as on measured pitch angle/look direction of the instrument. We found that the depletion signatures during some of the flybys show “ramp-like” features where only a partial depletion has been observed further away from the moon followed by nearly full absorption of electrons closer in. We interpret this as partially/fully connected to the flux tube connecting the moon with Cassini. During at least two of the flybys (with some evidence of one additional encounter) MIMI/LEMMS data are consistent with the presence of dust in energetic electron data when Cassini flew directly through the south polar plume. In addition we found gradients in the magnetic field components which are frequently found to be associated with changes in the MIMI/LEMMS particles intensities.

Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere.

       " 'S0019103511004994-1511': 'We use data taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini. MIMI/LEMMS is able to measure the intensities, energy spectra, and pitch angle distributions of energetic charged ions and electrons separately in the energy range between about 20 keV and several tens of MeV. Particles are measured simultaneously from two opposite directions (low-energy telescope (LE) and high-energy telescope (HE)). Low-energy electrons and ions measured in LE are separated by a strong internal magnet. Electrons are bent towards the two different detectors E and F while ions are detected in detectors A and B. The HE consists of a stack of five detectors. The species and energy separation is performed by coincidence measurements between these detectors. Data are recorded in rate channels. The instrument is mounted on top of a movable turntable which rotates about the −y-axis of the spacecraft within 86 s, nominally. The −y-axis points in the direction of the remote sensing instruments (often pointed towards the planet or another object). Under this configuration MIMI/LEMMS is therefore scanning in the x–z-plane of the spacecraft coordinate system allowing very good pitch angle coverage. Unfortunately the turntable stopped rotating in the beginning of 2005 for unknown reasons after the release of the Huygens probe. Therefore during all the Enceladus encounters MIMI/LEMMS was not rotating anymore. Since then the low-energy telescope points at an angle of 77.45° away from the −z direction towards the −x-direction (see Fig. 1). The advantage of that non-rotating mode is the time resolution of the instrument which is 16 times better than in the rotating mode (5.65 s) for the rate channels or 0.66 s for the priority channels instead of 86 s for a given pointing/pitch angle). This enables us to measure small-scale, short-lived features in the data set.',\n",

Absorption signatures are clearly visible in most of the displayed electron channels C1, C3, E0, E6, BE, and G1 (same is true for those not displayed here). The nominal energy passbands are given on the right-hand side of Fig. 2. Only the measurements in channel C1 during flybys E0 and E13 show no absorption signatures (off scale for E13). As mentioned above the region in the vicinity of a moon where electrons are absorbed (upstream or downstream) depends on their energy. Therefore it is important to know the flyby geometry during each encounter. Fig. 3 shows the trajectory of Cassini during the flybys E0, E12, and E13 close to the moon inside of 10 Enceladus radii REnc. We show the spacecraft trajectories projected into the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes of a coordinate system where the moon is in the center (x in plasma flow direction, y towards the planet and z northward). This frame is often referred to as the Enceladus Interaction System (ENIS). The individual flybys are labelled with the flyby numbers E0–E13, respectively. The measured differential intensity of electrons (56–100 keV) as measured in MIMI/LEMMS channel C3 is plotted in a color-code along the trajectory. Blue means low intensities, red1 and white high intensities. Clearly visible is a lack of electrons in this channel in the vicinity of the moon. The highest count rates further away from the moon are more typical of a magnetospheric distribution in that region of Saturn’s magnetosphere. The variation in the measured intensities are a combination of dynamic changes in the magnetosphere and from the fact that MIMI/LEMMS sampled different pitch angles during the individual flybys.',\n",

Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region.

These deviations do not necessarily mean the main interaction mode at Rhea is not plasma absorption. For instance, Simon et al. (2012) demonstrates that the combination of low magnetosonic Mach number and the high plasma beta values of Rhea’s space environment amplifies interaction features which for other plasma absorbers (e.g. Tethys, Dione, Earth’s Moon) are barely detectable. One of these features is a stronger, flow-aligned magnetic field component perturbation, which gives rise to mass-loading-like interaction signatures. Such structures may also complicate electron drifts, but to what extent it is uncertain. Similarly, the high plasma beta makes surface charging more important for Rhea compared to the other Saturnian moons (Roussos et al., 2010). Furthermore, recent developments in the study of Earth’s Moon interaction with the solar wind indicate that the standard picture for a lunar-type interaction may be too simplified: processes, such as the entry of exospheric pick-up ions in the center of the wake, backscattering on the surface and self-pick up of ambient plasma ions, appear to also have an impact on the wake dynamics (Halekas et al., 2011). For instance, the self-pick up process has been shown to lead to enhanced ULF wave activity in the lunar, at least 10% of the time (Nakagawa et al., 2012).

The thermosphere component globally solves the non-linear Navier–Stokes equations of momentum, continuity and energy on a spherical pressure level grid. The momentum equation includes terms such as pressure gradients, viscous drag, Coriolis acceleration, curvature accelerations and advection. The energy equation includes all processes of internal energy redistribution, such as advection, adiabatic heating and cooling as well as molecular and turbulent conduction. Solar EUV heating is calculated through explicit line-of-sight integration of solar irradiance attenuation (the Lambert–Beer Law), assuming solar spectra derived from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)/Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) (Woods et al., 2005; Woods, 2008) and heating efficiencies of 50%, a value in agreement with estimates for Jupiter by Waite et al.

Our model is presently unable to reproduce observed low and mid-latitude exospheric temperatures on Saturn, illustrating that magnetospheric energy is not being transported from the polar to the equatorial regions. This is related to Saturn’s fast rotation rate and the sub-corotation of the auroral thermosphere, which ultimately generates a meridional wind transporting energy from equator to pole in the deep atmosphere, thus cooling down the equatorial regions (Smith et al., 2007).

This, in turn, may control thermospheric temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2, the region of magnetospheric electric field is considerably wider than the electron precipitation region, so the Joule heating region extends over a much wider region as well. Therefore, solar radiation does affect high latitude temperatures by means of its role as source of ionisation. This causes hemispheric differences in high latitude temperatures at solstice. In our solstice simulation (R19) we find exospheric temperatures averaged from 74°S to 90°S (the summer polar region) of 490 K, while averaging over the same latitude band in the northern (winter) hemisphere gives a value of 430 K. This difference of 60 K is a direct result of enhanced ionisation in the summer hemisphere, leading to stronger Joule heating there. We expect solar cycle variations of high latitude temperatures to lie within the same approximate range, stronger in the summer hemisphere than winter hemisphere, where solar ionisation is considerably weaker. The solar ionisation-induced hemispheric differences in atmospheric conductivity should similarly affect the magnetosphere, highlighting an interesting Sun–atmosphere–magnetosphere coupling chain that deserves more thorough examination in future studies.',\n",

This result agrees well with the estimated variability of the Lyman α emissions from HD209458. The rotation period of HD209458 is estimated to be ∼10–11 days (Silva-Valio, 2008). The G140M observations covered three different transits and took place within a month and a half. Each observation covered approximately 2 h in time. Thus the data can be affected by short-term variability and it is essential that such variability be properly accounted for. For this reason, we compare our models with the results of Ben-Jaffel (2007, 2008) and Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) who analyzed the data in the time tag mode and accounted for variability before calculating transit depths.',\n",

Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010).

The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown).

Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.',\n",

The velocity structure is not detectable because the optical depth of the high velocity material is not sufficient, the LOS velocity at the limb of the planet is slower than the radial velocities in general, and because spectral line broadening within the COS instrument smooths the structure out of the line profiles. If the presence of velocity structure is confirmed in the data (Linsky et al., 2010), it probably implies that there is detached, optically thick plasma moving at large velocities around the planet. If this turns out to be the case, interaction with the stellar wind probably plays a role in giving rise to the observed absorption. Such interaction may also produce turbulence that can broaden the absorption further (e.g., Tian et al., 2005).

This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies.

The detection of Si2+ implies that condensation of Na in the lower atmosphere is unlikely (Paper II), and thus this result is unreliable. Relying on the same observations, Vidal-Madjar et al.

It is interesting to note that the temperature profile depends strongly on the heating efficiency but the location of the peak and the maximum temperature depend only weakly on ηnet.

Alternatively, with ηnet = 0.5 it may imply that the XUV flux of HD209458b is 5–10 times higher than the corresponding solar flux. This type of an enhancement is not impossible. The activity level of the star depends on its rotation rate, and the rotation rate of HD209458 may be twice as fast as the rotation rate of the Sun (Silva-Valio, 2008). However, the uncertainty of the observed H Lyman α transit depths accommodates a range of temperatures, and thus we are unable to derive firm constraints on the heating rates from the observations.

We use a 1-D photochemical model to calculate the deposition rates of sulfate, nitrogen oxyanions, and perchlorate from Mars’ atmosphere, given a plausible range of volcanic fluxes of sulfur- and chlorine-containing gases in the past. To calculate integrated fluxes over time, we assume that throughout the last 3 byr (the Amazonian eon), the typical background atmosphere would have been similar to today’s cold and dry environment. If the soil has been mixed by impact perturbations to a characteristic depth of ∼2 m during this time, given a time-average volcanic flux 0.1% of the modern terrestrial volcanic flux, the model suggests that the soil would have accumulated 1.0–1.7 wt.% SO42- and 0.2–0.4 wt.% N in the form of pernitrate (peroxynitrate) or nitrate. The calculated sulfate concentration is consistent with in situ observations of soils from rovers and landers and orbital gamma ray spectroscopy.

The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013).

We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.',\n",

The estimates also compare well with an average ∼6.8 wt.% sulfur as SO3 (2.7 wt.% S) in global soil inferred from elemental abundances measured at various locations on Mars by Spirit, Opportunity, Pathfinder, and Viking Landers. We can also compare the average sulfur content in the top few tens of centimeters of the soil of ∼4.4 wt.% inferred from Gamma Ray Spectrometer measurements (King and McLennan, 2010).

These concentrations are both many orders of magnitude lower than the observed abundance at the Phoenix landing site: 0.4–0.6 wt. % (Hecht et al., 2009).

We vary the input of N and NO into the model, using the nominal case as an upper limit. As these values are decreased, the pernitrate deposition flux drops, which is shown in Fig. 5.

A combination of such factors, including reduced odd nitrogen fluxes, higher oxygen mixing ratios, and increased temperatures may have worked in concert to produce larger perchlorate:nitrate ratios. Specifically, if odd nitrogen downward fluxes and oxygen escape rates are smaller than currently thought, nitrate fluxes would drop while perchlorate fluxes would increase. In conjunction, as the surface temperature warms toward 280 K (as it does in the current equatorial summer) local perchlorate production fluxes could increase further. While it is possible to tweak the photochemical model into this mode, it is difficult to imagine a self-consistent scenario where all of these processes are working in concert to create high perchlorate:nitrate and perchlorate:chloride ratios on Mars, so we favor an additional source for perchlorate.',\n",

This mass will be referred to as the “sensed mass” in this article to distinguish it from the adsorbed mass of the protein. The exposure to the Mefp-1 solution leads to initial rapid adsorption, as expected for a protein showing high affinity for the adsorbent. After this initial rapid adsorption, a slower increase in the sensed mass is observed, suggesting a continuous build-up of the Mefp-1 layer. Since the substrate is a pre-conditioned iron surface that is not as stable as a model silica surface, the adsorption of Mefp-1 was interrupted after 10 min to prevent non-negligible corrosion of the substrate within the period of measurement. The protein solution was removed by injection of a protein free 10 μm FeCl3 solution into the cell, which allows the investigation of Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the pre-adsorbed protein layer. As shown in Fig. 2, the exposure of the adsorbed layer to the FeCl3 solution leads to a decrease in the sensed mass, which can arise from removal of some loosely bound Mefp-1 and/or some of the coupled water in the protein layer.

Comparing with the 15 min Mefp-1 spectrum (Fig. 6a), the intensity of negative water band is relatively larger after exposing the Mefp-1 layer to the FeCl3 solution (Fig. 8a), which indicates that water is released from the pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 layer. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the addition of the Fe3+ makes the Mefp-1 film more compact, in agreement with the QCM-D and AFM results. It should be noted that the spectra obtained with the addition of FeCl3 are remarkably similar to those without the FeCl3 addition but after sufficiently long exposure in the Mefp-1 solution, which indicates that Fe3+ could also be generated from the oxidized iron surface. We note that the broad and unresolved 1540 cm−1 peak is more clearly split into two separate peaks at 1550 cm−1 and 1536 cm−1 (Fig. 8b). This is not surprising since the DFT analysis showed that the 1540 cm−1 peak had contributions from both the backbone and the catechol unit, and that these bands may be influenced differently by the change in aqueous solvation when the water content of the protein film becomes reduced. It should also be recognized that the effect of subtracting the water spectrum may influence the two spectra slightly differently in this region. However, more importantly the peaks, at 1485 cm−1 and 1260 cm−1 (Fig. 8b), which we have associated with the complexation between catechol and Fe3+, remain largely unaltered both in terms of frequencies and intensities.

       " 'S0022000014000026-18167': \"As the conclusion of our paper, we now assess to which extent the properties of our implementation of the FATAL+ algorithm, which have been expressed and verified within our modeling framework and tested experimentally, meet our design goals. Furthermore, we will discuss a number of potential improvements and future research avenues. Our exposition will follow the optimization criteria listed in Section 2.1.7.•Area consumption: For a suitable implementation, the total number of gates is O(nlogn) per node. This can be seen by observing that the complexity of the threshold gates is dominating the asymptotic number of gates, since the O(n) remaining components of a node have a constant number of gates each; using sorting networks to implement threshold gates, the stated complexity bound follows [48]. Trivially, this number of gates is a factor of O(logn) from optimal. We conjecture that in fact this complexity is asymptotically optimal, unless one is willing to sacrifice other desirable properties of the algorithm (e.g. optimal resilience). Assuming that the gate complexity of the nodes adequately represents the area consumption of our algorithm, we conclude that our solution is satisfactory in that regard.•Communication complexity: Our implementation uses 7 (1-bit) wires per channel, and sequential encoding of the states of the main state machine would reduce this number to 5. All communication are broadcasts. Considering the complexity of the task, there seems to be very limited room for improvement.•Stabilization time: Our algorithm has a stabilization time of O(n) in the worst case. Recent findings [49] show that a polylogarithmic stabilization time can be achieved at a low communication complexity; however, this comes at the expense of suboptimal resilience, a weaker adversarial model, and, most importantly, constants in the complexity bounds that make the resulting algorithm inferior to our solution for any practical range of parameters. Moreover, as formalized in [13] and demonstrated in Section 7, for a wide range of scenarios our algorithm achieves constant stabilization time. Considering the severe fault model, we conclude that despite not being optimal, our algorithm performs satisfactory with respect to this quality measure.•Resilience: It is known that 3f+1 nodes are necessary to tolerate f faults [25,14] unless cryptographic tools are available. Since the complexity incurred by cryptographic tools is prohibitive in our setting, our algorithm features optimal resilience.•Delays: As mentioned, the delay of wires is outside our control. Taking dmin+ and dmax+ into account in the quick cycle machine, we make best use of the available bounds in terms of the final frequency/synchrony trade-off. The delays incurred by the computations performed at nodes are proportional to the depths of the involved circuits. Again, the implementation of the threshold gates is the dominant cost factor here. The sorting network by Ajtai et al. [48] exhibits depth O(logn). Assuming constant fan-in of gates, this is clearly asymptotically optimal if the decision when to increase the logical clock Lv next indeed depends on all n−1 input signals of v from remote nodes. We conclude that, so far as within our control, the design goal of minimizing the incurred delays is met by our algorithm.•Metastability: We discussed several effective measures to prevent metastability in Section 6. Our experiments support our theoretical finding that, after stabilization, metastability may not occur in absence of further faults. However, since metastability is an elusive problem for which it is difficult to transfer insights and observations to other modes of operation of a given system—let alone to different implementation technology—a mathematical treatment of metastability is highly desirable. Our model opens up various possible approaches to this issue. For one, it is feasible to switch to a more accurate description of signals in terms of signals' voltages as continuous functions of time. Another option choosing an intermediate level of complexity would be to add an additional signal state (e.g. ⊥) for “invalid” signals, representing e.g. creeping or oscillating signals. Assigning appropriate probabilities of metastability propagation and decay to modules, this would enable a unified probabilistic analysis of metastability generation, propagation, and decay within a modeling framework using discrete state representations. Such an approach could yield entirely unconditional guarantees on system recovery; in contrast, our current description requires an a priori guarantee that metastability is sufficiently contained during the stabilization process.•Connectivity: The algorithm presented in this work requires to connect all pairs of nodes and is therefore not scalable. Unfortunately, it is known that Ω(n2) links are required for tolerating f∈Ω(n) faults in the worst case [26,27]. We argued for the assumption of worst-case behavior of faulty nodes; however, it appears reasonable that typical systems will not exhibit a worst-case distribution of faults within the system. Indeed, many interesting scenarios justify to assume a much more benign distribution of faults. In the extreme case where faults are distributed uniformly and independently at random with a constant probability, say, 10%, of a node being faulty, node degrees of Δ∈O(clogn) would suffice to guarantee (at a given point in time) that the probability that more than Δ/9 neighbors of any node are faulty, is at most 1−1/nc. Note that this implies that the mean time until this property is violated polynomially grows with system size. Using the FATAL+ protocol in small subsystems (of less than Δ nodes), system-wide synchronization will be much easier to achieve than if one would start from scratch. In this setting, Δ∈O(logn) would replace n in all complexity bounds of the FATAL+ algorithm, resulting in particular in gate complexity O(lognloglogn) per node, computational delay O(loglogn), and stabilization time O(clogn) with probability 1−1/nc. Thus, this approach promises “local” fault-tolerance of Ω(Δ) faults in each neighborhood in combination with excellent scalability in all complexity measures, and realizing this is a major goal of our future work.•Clock size: The constraint (1) entails that either clock size is bounded or large clocks result in larger stabilization time. This restriction can be overcome if we use the clocks of bounded size generated by FATAL+ as input to another layer that runs a synchronous consensus algorithm in order to agree on exponentially larger clocks [41]. Finally, we would like to mention two more prospective extensions of our work. First, building on our modeling framework, it seems feasible to tackle an even more strict verification of the algorithm's properties than “standard” mathematical analysis. The hierarchical structure and formal specifications of modules seem amenable to formal verification methods. Such an approach should benefit from the possibilities to adjust the granularity of the model by the distinction between basic and compound modules as well as the restrictions imposed by the module specifications; more restrictive modules may be simpler to analyze, yet will guarantee the same properties as the stated variants. Second, it should be noted that it is straightforward to derive clocks of even higher frequency from the FATAL+ clocks. This is essentially done by frequency multiplication, at the expense of increasing the clock skew. We refer to Dolev et al. [13] for details.\",\n",

       " 'S0022399913003358-1044': 'Self-reported hearing difficulty was the strongest association with tinnitus. Previous research has shown that around 40% of 55–74 year olds with hearing difficulties also report tinnitus [36], and the majority of tinnitus patients have some degree of hearing loss [37]. No single theory explaining the cause of tinnitus is universally accepted, but one theory suggests that tinnitus may result from an increase of central gain (to compensate for deprived sensory inputs) which amplifies neural noise in order to maintain neural homeostasis [38]. It is likely that the severity of tinnitus is influenced by a complex interaction involving auditory, psychological and emotional networks [39,40]. It is interesting that neuroticism is a strong association with current tinnitus, albeit not as strong as hearing difficulty. Furthermore, of those who have tinnitus, neuroticism has a stronger effect on the perceived severity than hearing difficulty. One explanation could be that those who are more neurotic may think their tinnitus is indicative of a more serious condition and therefore find the tinnitus more bothersome. The finding that personality traits such as neuroticism can contribute to tinnitus awareness and distress is important when considering treatment approaches because personality traits are generally stable over time [41], although the absolute level of personality traits can change [42]. Thus it is possible that psychological interventions may be beneficial for tinnitus patients although the effects may be gradual [11].',\n",

Subjective tinnitus is a common and disturbing phenomenon, with a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 20% [2–5] in the general population, and an estimated 10 year incidence rate in adults aged over 48 years of 13% [6].

Additionally, particular cognitive strategies, for example, dysfunctional and catastrophic thoughts can increase patients' emotional distress and perceived tinnitus severity, and are thought to be closely related to personality factors [15]. Neuroticism is expressed as “individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions” [16] (p. 301). At one extreme, individuals are characterized by high levels of vulnerability to experience negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and insecurity [17]. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer [18], and an increased likelihood of arthritis, kidney/liver disease, and diabetes in the general population [19]. There is evidence that neurotic traits are stronger in tinnitus patients [20], particularly in those with higher levels of tinnitus annoyance, and recent evidence that neuroticism may predict the development of severe tinnitus in patients already experiencing some tinnitus [21]. In a cross-sectional sample of 530 participants (50% with chronic tinnitus), Bartels and colleagues [22] studied the role of type D personality (the tendency towards negative affectivity and social inhibition) on health-related quality of life and self-reported tinnitus-related distress. Tinnitus patients with type D personality reported greater tinnitus-related distress and poorer health-related quality of life compared to those with other personality types.

Since the premise of the investigation was to quantify the relationship between biological richness and soil structural changes over time, the soils were not pre-incubated prior to the start of the experiment. Therefore, microbial communities were allowed to develop during the course of the 7 month experiment either in the presence of mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots, or in unplanted soil, thereby allowing root associated changes in community development to be measured. Others, for example Griffiths et al. (2001) and Wertz et al.

In the mycorrhizal soils, aggregate water repellency was also negatively correlated with bacterial (and fungal) TRF richness but positively correlated with root size and microbial biomass-C. It is likely that mycorrhizal hyphae contributed to the microbial biomass-C measured here which might explain why microbial biomass-C was not a factor in the model explaining repellency in the NM soils. In the mycorrhizal soils the relationship between microbial biomass-C and aggregate stability was negative, whilst it was positive for repellency.

For example, aggregate stability was greater in the mycorrhizal soils in month 3, yet repellency increased in months 5 and 7. The positive relationship observed between per cent root length colonised and microbial biomass-C is likely to be the result of increasing hyphal length in the soil, or possibly an enhancement of other microbial species too, since internal AMF root colonisation may not reflect the extraradical hyphal biomass.

Miller and Knudsen (1987) reported larger antisunward velocities within the ionosphere on the dawn side than on the dusk side above an altitude of 400 km, with the pattern reversed below this altitude. The dawn–dusk asymmetry below 400 km was largely attributed to photoionisation as plasma in the post-noon sector had been exposed to sunlight for longer than plasma in the pre-noon sector. The plasma flow from the dayside to the nightside was driven by the day-to-night pressure gradient, with the higher plasma densities in the post-noon sector enhancing the nightward transport of ions on the dusk side. The super-rotation of the neutral atmosphere also enhanced the ion flow on the dusk side and reduced the flow on the dawn side due to collisional interactions between the ions and the neutral species. A subsequent modelling study at the altitude of the peak density in the ionosphere (∼140 km) showed that differences in the thermospheric composition between the dawn and dusk sides may also cause asymmetries in the ionosphere at these altitudes due to changes in the dominant chemical reactions (Fox and Kasprzak, 2007).',\n",

Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al.

This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15.

The DN-4PB tests of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers were performed to investigate the process further. After fracture at 20 °C, the plastic zone at the tip of the sub-critically loaded crack was sectioned and observed using transmission optical microscopy. This showed that a large feather-like deformation zone was formed, see Fig. 16. This feather-like zone comprises highly plastically dilated cavities and localised shear-bands [12,48]. Transmission optical micrographs of the subsurface damage zone of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers tested at different temperatures revealed that the size of the subsurface damage zone decreased as the test temperature decreased, see Fig. 17. This reduction in the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip is due to the increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer at low temperatures.',\n",
       " 'S0032386113005454-2886': 'The toughening events of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers can be summarised as localised shear-banding of the epoxy polymer initiated by the particles and internal cavitation of the S-CSR particles (which relieves the triaxial stress-state in the vicinity of the crack tip) followed by void growth. These events contribute to the relatively high toughness measured from the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers. The differences observed at low temperatures indicate that the increase of the cavitational resistance of the S-CSR particles delays the cavitation process and enhances the localised shear-band yielding process. The increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer attenuates the deformation of the polymer and reduces the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip, but this effect is compensated for by the increased energy absorption from the enhanced shear-band yielding. Hence, there is a reduction of the toughening performance of the S-CSR particles at low temperatures, but the competition between these effects results in the fracture energy being independent of the test temperature between −55 °C and −109 °C.',\n",

The method used has been fully described elsewhere [49] and essentially it proposes that the criterion for debonding is based upon the energy released by the debonding process. To obtain the parameters needed for this energy-based criterion, a finite-element analysis modelling study has been used to derive the change in strain-energy arising from the cavitation process, with the addition of the strain-energy stored in the particle prior to debonding. The applied stress used for these simulations was derived from experimental observations. Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size. It has therefore been assumed that the debonding takes place at an applied uniaxial stress of about 70 MPa, which equates to a hydrostatic stress at the crack tip of about 210 MPa. Thus, the finite-element analysis simulations were analysed for an applied hydrostatic stress of 210 MPa.',\n",

       " 'S0038071712001010-1044': 'Despite the lack of correlation between aggregate stability and AMF, rapid growth of G. mosseae hyphae suggested by Jansa et al. (2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species. Work by Giovannetti et al. (2001, 2004) demonstrated that AMF hyphae frequently anastamose and could result in a large network of interconnecting hyphae. Within the current experiment, colonisation by G. mosseae resulted in a higher proportion of small soil pores to large ones and reduced distances between neighbouring pores. A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (∼0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001). In contrast, G. intraradices led to soil with a greater number of large pores and all combinations of G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between neighbouring pores. Bearden (2001) concluded, in a study of soil–water characteristics, that AMF hyphae resulted in soils gaining groups of small pores which corroborates the current findings, although it is interesting that different Glomus species affect the size and distance between pores differently. Bearden (2001) used a combination of six Glomus species (including G. mosseae) in her investigation of vertisols. In contrast, Milleret et al. (2009) found no evidence of G. intraradices forming small diameter structural pores and the larger size of the pores relative to the AMF led them to conclude that pore development was an indirect effect of the mycorrhiza. Since the extraradical hyphae had a smaller diameter than the pores, the authors suggested that hyphal penetration of pores induced root exudation and increased microbial activity. The data in the current investigation show that plant roots, possibly by influencing the associated microbial biomass and not colonisation by AMF per se, positively affected aggregate stability. Previous studies (e.g. Bedini et al., 2009) showed that aggregate stability is affected by the plant-fungal system rather than by plant root metabolism. Hallett et al. (2009) performed an elegant experiment in which mycorrhizal-deficient and ‘wild type’ tomato plants were grown in an agricultural field soil amended with G. mosseae and G. intraradices. These authors demonstrated that aggregate stability and porosity were increased in planted soils irrespective of the plant type (and mycorrhizal status) and they conclude that roots drive the stabilisation of soil structure. Their experiment lasted for 84 days and during this time the soil experienced wet–dry cycles which may have encouraged microbial populations to produce polysaccharides which in turn enhanced aggregate production. However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability. Whilst it has been shown before that different AMF species may affect aggregate stability (Schreiner et al., 1997), the focus here is on the effects of the mycelium in addition to the mycorrhiza. No correlations were observed for AMF hyphal abundance and soil physical properties, demonstrating that the differences observed may relate to growth patterns and mycelium architecture rather than density, or perhaps to AMF-specific altered C-exudation since AM fungi are known to produce extracellular soil proteins such as glomalin (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996). The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.',\n",

Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.\",\n",

However, lakes are especially prone to a reservoir effect, due to dissolution of ancient carbonates and/or old organic matter that is washed into the lake from the catchment and incorporated into the sediment. Both phenomena can result in anomalous 14C ages and an offset from the real age of the dated material, which is not necessarily constant through time in the sediment section (Geyh et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2007). This offset from the real age can be of the order of several hundred or even more than a thousand years if bulk sediment or carbonates are dated, and can thus lead to misleading or erroneous age models if it is not taken into account (Geyh et al., 1998; Bertrand et al., 2012). Sediment sections spanning time intervals with multiple tephra layers could therefore easily be miscorrelated if the tephra is not adequately characterised to back up correlations.

Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77 K) [4] with a record of ∼16 wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6]. However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material. There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use.

It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state. These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities. Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study. Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.',\n",

There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species. We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120 m to 380 m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers. Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000 stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations. Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.',\n",

Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted.

Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows.

The distribution of regenerating saplings will therefore be partly controlled by the behaviour of the dispersing animal.

However, our findings are in contrast to previous work carried out in lowland sites in the UK that found positive relationships between the number of oak seedlings and distance to parent trees but no significant effect for birch seedlings (Harmer et al., 2005), possibly indicating differences between the shelterwood examined by Harmer et al.

The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method. Another benefit of the log-law method is that it has been extensively used in the literature, making comparison of our results with previous results more straightforward.',\n",

This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash.

       " 'S0925443913001385-1319': 'The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].',\n",

The C-terminal domain (CTD) (107 to end in Escherichia coli) is conserved in evolution [50] and is required for initial binding and GTPase activation for both EF-Tu and EF-G. Indeed, both EF-Tu and EF-G have greatly diminished GTPase activity on ribosomes lacking the CTD of L12 [51,52]. Superimposition of MRPL12 with the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome (PDB code: 2WRL) lacking L7/L12 stalk proteins shows that MRPL12 Ala181 is located within this highly conserved region (Fig. 3A). Moreover, modeling of MRPL12 shows Ala181 positioned in a helix potentially involved in translation factor interactions (Fig. 3A/B). Bacterial L7/L12 CTDs also contain a number of strictly conserved residues that are involved in the initial contact with elongation factors [52,53] and crucial for translation [54]. Alanine is one of the best helix forming residues and substitutions can therefore have profound energetic effects by perturbing packing interactions or tertiary contacts [55]. Thus, the p.Ala181Val change might be predicted to alter interactions with the elongation factors, and since MRPL7/12 bound to elongation factors is predicted to have a higher affinity for the ribosome [54], the mutation may in turn affect both rate and accuracy of mitochondrial translation.',\n",

In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.\",\n",

On analysis MRPL12 from the patient was substantially decreased in all fractions but detectable in the fractions consistent with mt-LSU; however it was noticeably absent from the free pool (fractions 1 and 2, Fig. 5). This was in contrast to the control that exhibited a pool of free MRPL12, which has been reported to interact with POLRMT [56]. MRPL3 was also slightly reduced in subject cells but remained in fractions consistent with the large subunit. The MRPL12 mutation impacted more modestly on the small ribosomal subunit, with DAP3 apparently unaffected and MRPS18B found in lower amounts only in fractions 4 and 5 but otherwise with similar steady state levels and distribution profile compared to control. Since POLRMT and MRPL12 have been published as interactors, we analyzed both the steady state level and gradient distribution of POLRMT to see if these were affected by the MRPL12 mutation.

L7/L12 is also phosphorylated, which can affect both conformation and binding to partner ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Ref. [37]). This modification has now been confirmed to be present in mammalian MRPL12 [59]. In eubacteria, association of L7/12 to the large subunit takes place via the L10 protein such that two L7/L12 heterodimers normally associate per LSU [60]. Interestingly these dimers are actively exchanged on the 70S molecule without disruption of the ribosomal particle [54,61]. The dimerization status and number of dimers attached to the human 55S has not been clarified. In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate demonstrated similar levels small subunit polypeptides including DAP3 and MRPS18B in subject and control samples. In contrast, the total amount of MRPL12 was reduced (Fig. 7B). In the patient the IP is restricted to MRPL12 in the large subunit or the fully assembled 55S with the total amount of MRPL12 being reduced as it lacks the “free” population. The densitometric measurements indicate that the patient IP has ~ 49% MRPL12 compared to control, in accordance with the gradient and steady state data. ICT1 appears to be sensitive to the MRPL12 levels and so is reduced in both the IP (~ 58% of control) and in the steady state westerns (Fig. 4). The lower levels of MRPL12 could reflect loss of multimerization but since the region in the bacterial protein involved in multimerization is towards the N-terminus [62], this mutation is unlikely to have an impact on dimer/multimer formation. The translation factor bound dimer has been suggested to have an increased affinity for the ribosome [54,61]. Thus a possible explanation is that the mutation affects translation factor binding, thereby reducing the affinity of the mutant MRPL12 for the ribosome. If this were the case, however, then we would expect an increase in the pool of free MRPL12 whereas the subject exhibits a reduced pool of free MRPL12, which interacts with POLRMT [57]. The immunoprecipitation was performed using an MRPL12 specific antibody and so should contain all free MRPL12, MRPL12 associated with uncomplexed mt-LSU and MRPL12 as part of the fully assembled 55S. Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components. Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.',\n",

The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost.

STC represent rather favourable operating conditions for most PV technologies as it is an unrealistic combination of a cold module temperature (25 °C) at a high irradiance (1000 W/m2). Different modules, even of the same technology, generally have different rated powers and the energy yields must be made comparable in any inter-comparison study.

The effect for CIGS is slightly contradictory as there is no clarity of the time scales involved yet [4,50].

It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes.

The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41].

       " 'S0927775713009606-1074': 'A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described. This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid. The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.',\n",

It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase. CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or “seeds” (as indicated from XRD data). As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase. As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase. This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.',\n",

In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies. However, the generator efficiency with the reference strategy is lower at high wind frequencies. This reduced efficiency is due to high resistive loss caused by the high generator torque during the rapid oscillations.

One observed issue with the separate topology is that the turbines in front easily get high rotational velocities for the peak wind speeds. It is shown in Ref. [11] that for rapid increases in wind speed, the turbine temporarily obtains a higher rotational velocity and power before the wake has formed. For rapid decreases in wind speed, the existing wake causes an additional drop in wind speed. Hence the rotational velocity and the extracted power drop below the steady state value before the wake has drifted away. For the square configuration, a rapid increase in wind speed causes the front turbine to obtain a high rotational velocity, which generates a large wake behind the turbine. This large wake will drift into the downwind turbine, hence reducing the rotational velocity of the second turbine. This effect is seen in Fig. 15 at 1050 and 1170 s, where an increase in rotational velocity for turbines 1 and 3 in the separate case is followed by a rapid decrease in rotational velocity for turbine 3.

However recommendation systems differ considerably among countries. Not many systems can be found as peer reviewed literature; however a brief overview on those available is hereby given. Phosphorus recommendation systems are commonly used in Brazil, in a country where soils are generally nutrient poor. The Brazilian recommendation systems are based on quantitative analyses of soil input variables. The input variable consists of the following factors; cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), base sum, exchangeable aluminium (Al), calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg), potassium (K) and P levels, sodium (Na) saturation and electrical conductivity. The output variable of the system is the amount of fertilizer to be applied. This is mainly based on 4 classes, low, medium, high to very high (Palhares et al., 2001). While Brazil follows a detailed set of variables when recommending P fertilizer levels, the agronomists at Kansas University – who, among other land grant Universities in the United States, provide single rate recommendation for nutrients such as P – are developing a fertilizer recommendation system that gives growers the flexibility to choose a soil management practice suitable for their needs. This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the “nutrient sufficiency recommendation system” which is developed to provide a 90–95% maximum yield for the year, and the “build maintenance fertility program” based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4–8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003).

This yield potential is used as an input into a static model together with field specific data such as recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous NPK supply and maximum NPK accumulation.

The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.',\n",

Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010).

There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).',\n",

(2010) performed simulations on multiple realizations of the Ketzin reservoir using a stochastic Monte Carlo approach in order to take into account the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir characterization at the scale required for fluid flow simulations. In this paper, we use a similar approach, but this time to investigate the impact of the reservoir temperature on the fluid migration and, in turn, on the 4D seismic data. Hydrogeological studies at the Ketzin site (Norden et al., 2010) have shown that a 2D radially symmetric model of the upper part (33 m) of the Stuttgart Formation can be used to interpret the 3D data acquired near the injection well (Fig. 7). This model accounts for the presence of channel sandstones in the reservoir that are the most favorable for CO2 migration and contains effective porosities in the range of 20–25% (Förster et al., 2010). As known from core and log analysis of the injection well Ktzi201/2007 and the first observation well Ktzi200/2007, the reservoir is composed of two high porosity sandstone layers. These layers are separated by a thin strongly cemented sandstone layer (Norden et al., 2010). Since the thickness of this layer is in the decimeter range, it cannot be detected with the seismic wavelengths typically available from surface-seismic measurements. However, this layer is known to be a significant constraint to fluid migration due to its low permeability (Wiese et al., 2010).',\n",

To demonstrate this we calculated the difference in Vp between both temperature scenarios present at the Ketzin site at the time of the 1st 3D seismic repeat campaign (Ivanova et al., 2012) using Gassmann's equations (1951) for 50% CO2 saturation. The resulting difference between the scenarios in Vp is less than 5 m/s. Considering the uncertainties (e.g. ±5% error in CO2 saturation) in the petrophysical experiments (Kummerow and Spangenberg, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2012) corresponding to ±70 m/s in Vp (Fig. 5), we did not take into account the Vp changes (Fig. 5, Eq.

Seismic amplitude differences between the 38 °C and 34 °C scenarios correspond to less than 1% of the amplitude values of the baseline (Fig. 8). Since the normalized root mean square (NRMS) differences in the 3D time-lapse data are greater than 10% (Kashubin et al., 2011) these temperature effects in the reservoir will not be resolvable with surface seismic methods at the Ketzin site.',\n",

Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well.

The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.\",\n",

It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.',\n",
       " 'S1750583613004192-1689': 'The modeled low shale barrier threshold pressures are potentially indicative of fracturing. However, the current pressure regime is extremely unlikely to cause fracturing, and so it is inferred that the shales may have been pervasively fractured in the past. A fracturing process consistent with the geological history of the region is that the shale barriers have undergone a transient pulse of fluid overpressure sufficient to fracture the rock. Such a pressure history could be a consequence of the rapid unloading of hundreds of meters of ice from the overburden during a deglaciation. A transient ice sheet load equivalent to 10 MPa of overpressure could have been removed rapidly by melting, or instantly by a sea level rise and the flotation of an ice sheet grounded on the seabed, during a typical ablation timespan of less than a few thousand years. At the shallow burial depth of these shales, 10 MPa is sufficient to exceed the tensional rock strength and cause pervasive hydraulic fracturing. This may have happened as a consequence of one or more regional ice sheet excursions into the basin. While the strength and thickness of the overburden at any given ice collapse is unknown, a conservative approximation for the fracture gradient, based on present-day leak-off tests (Nicoll, 2012), suggests that such an event is plausible.',\n",

We observed extensive GFP+ human fiber bundles coexpressing hCA and peripherin (Figures 4Q and 4R). In contrast, no hCA or peripherin expression was detected in the neural tube of the embryo (Figure S5D). The in vivo fiber outgrowth 2 days after transplantation was reminiscent of the extensive in vitro fiber outgrowth of replated trigeminal neuron clusters (Figure S5A). Peripherin expression in vivo (Figure 4S) confirmed the peripheral neuron identity of the grafted cells.',\n",

The trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem receive afferent innervation from the trigeminal sensory ganglion that is relayed to the contralateral thalamus. The pons was selected as site for transplantation, because it is surgically accessible and located within proximity of the trigeminal brain stem nuclei that receive afferent input from the trigeminal ganglia. Hence, GFP+ human trigeminal neuron clusters were injected into adult NOD/SCID mice via stereotactic surgery (see Experimental Procedures). Histological analysis 4 weeks after transplantation showed survival of GFP+ human cell graft in the ventral pons (Figure S5E). Although GFP+ cell bodies remained tightly clustered at injection site, GFP+ fibers showed extensive projections into the host brain (n = 6) including the endogenous trigeminal nuclei (Figure S5F). Expression of BRN3A confirmed the sensory neuron identity of the cells (Figure S5G). Graft-derived human fiber bundles (hNCAM+ and GFP+) were observed emanating from the graft core (Figure S5H). These data demonstrate in vivo survival of trigeminal placode derivatives, differentiation along sensory neuron lineage, and the establishment of axonal projections toward relevant endogenous targets in the embryonic chick and adult mouse brain.',\n",

Findings are also consistent with imaging studies that have observed frontal activity during auditory tasks.22Although many paired-click studies have examined the association between frontal activity and gating measures (e.g., second click divided by first click), studies examining associations between paired-click ratio scores and frontal activity but not also associations between first click activity and frontal activity are not discussed as findings between ratio scores and frontal activity are outside the scope of this study (e.g., EEG studies such as Williams et al. (2011) and fMRI studies such as Tregellas et al. (2007) and Mayer et al. (2009)). For example, examining auditory responses in patients with epilepsy using intracranial microelectrode grids, Korzyukov et al.

Similar to present findings in controls, Boutros et al. observed activity in the posterior part of STG and in left ventral prefrontal cortex (more exact comparisons between the two studies in terms of frontal activity are difficult, as many subjects in Boutros et al. did not have electrodes placed in anterior frontal regions). Boutros et al. (2011) also observed 100 ms auditory activity in middle temporal gyrus, parietal, cingulate, and occipital regions. Activity observed in similar but not identical locations in these other areas in the present study may be due to the significant latency variability Boutros et al. (2011) observed in several regions.

While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data.

Inspecting the most important features that differentiate children born with hearing impairment from children with normal hearing in this study, we see some features that are in line with hypotheses about under stimulation of auditory function in HI infants; while other observations already begin to add to our knowledge of how congenital deafness affects brain development and function. For example, features B, F, H, and I include known components of the auditory language network which our group and others have previously shown to be engaged by the narrative comprehension task (Karunanayaka et al., 2007; Schmithorst et al., 2006). These features include (B) the planum temporale and primary auditory cortex in the left hemisphere (including Wernicke's area, the classical language recognition module), as well as the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus at the temporal parietal junction of the (F) left and (H, I) right hemispheres, known auditory and visual language association regions. Although all participants were bilaterally severely to profoundly hearing impaired, we observe left dominant auditory/language related activity present in components A, B, and F. In addition, components H and I contain right hemisphere auditory/language activity. Functional features such as these are not unexpected in terms of regions of differential cortical activation between HI and NH children listening to natural language as an auditory stimulus and it is reassuring to see these regions highlighted by our algorithm as potential biomarkers corresponding to hearing impairment. Similarly, there is evidence of differential activation in subcortical features corresponding to the auditory brainstem pathways. Features A, D, and J include elements of the reticular auditory pathway of the brainstem which has been identified by electrophysiological studies to have a key role in auditory perception of location of sounds as well as the ability to filter a source of sound in background noise. Roughly these features appear to encompass key elements of the auditory pathway at the level of the pons (D) including the cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, lateral lemniscus and superior olive on the right, (A) inferior colliculus, medial geniculate on the left and (J) thalamus bilaterally (Kretschmann and Weinrich, 1998). Although the resolution of the fMRI scans (4 × 4 × 5 mm) is not sufficient to resolve these structures individually, differences in activation in these regions, as indicated by reference to the higher resolution anatomical images, suggest that brain stem auditory nuclei may be involved.\",\n",

A PCR analysis revealed that all of the clones with retroviral vectors showed apparent expression of remaining transgenes (Figures S1C and S1D), whereas the clones with episomal vectors never did (Figure S1F).

The expression level of the mRNAs was approximately 1:100 compared with peripheral blood cells in both fibroblast- and blood-cell-derived iPSCs, which was again increased by exposure to IFN-γ (Figure 2B).

The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells. An immunofluorescence study revealed that more CD45+ cells (a marker for pan-leukocytes) accumulated in allografts compared with autografts (Figures 3I and 3J). Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).

This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ.

       " 'S2213671113000921-994': 'Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.',\n",

A positive pan-cytokeratin (pCK) signal, an established RPE marker, was confirmed for fetal and adult hRPE monolayers (Figures 3A and 3C). Additional pCK reactivity was seen “underneath” the cell carrier, likely from host RPE. Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3). Costaining of SC121 with an antibody to MCT1 and Ezrin, both apical membrane markers, further confirmed that the RPE were (still) polarized (Figure 3). SC121+ RPE transplants were negative for the expression of the cell-cycle marker ki67, the proliferation marker phosphohistone H3, and for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (Figures 3F–3H), indicating absence of proliferation and apoptosis. We estimated the total human RPE cell survival to be approximately 95% after 1 month by using the SC121 positivity; we measured the total length of the carrier and the length of SC121 stain and calculated the percent coverage of SC121 over the total carrier length. On transmission electron micrography (TEM), polarized RPE cells were observed on the PET carriers from both fetal and adult transplants (Figures 3I and 3J).

       "'[CLS] As the conclusion of our paper, we now assess to which extent the properties of our implementation of the FATAL + algorithm, which have been expressed and verified within our modeling framework and tested experimentally, meet our design goals. Furthermore, we will discuss a number of potential improvements and future research avenues. Our exposition will follow the optimization criteria listed in Section 2. 1. 7. • Area consumption : For a suitable implementation, the total number of gates is O ( nlogn ) per node. This can be seen by observing that the complexity of the threshold gates is dominating the asymptotic number of gates, since the O ( n ) remaining components of a node have a constant number of gates each ; using sorting networks to implement threshold gates, the stated complexity bound follows [ 48 ]. Trivially, this number of gates is a factor of O ( logn ) from optimal. We conjecture that in fact this complexity is asymptotically optimal, unless one is willing to sacrifice other desirable properties of the algorithm ( e. g. optimal resilience ). Assuming that the gate complexity of the nodes adequately represents the area consumption of our algorithm, we conclude that our solution is satisfactory in that regard. • Communication complexity : Our implementation uses 7 ( 1 - bit ) wires per channel, and sequential encoding of the states of the main state machine would reduce this number to 5. All communication are broadcasts. Considering the complexity of the task, there seems to be very limited room for improvement. • Stabilization time : Our algorithm has a stabilization time of O ( n ) in the worst case. Recent findings [ 49 ] show that a polylogarithmic stabilization time can be achieved at a low communication complexity ; however, this comes at the expense of suboptimal resilience, a weaker adversarial model, and, most importantly, constants in the complexity bounds that make the resulting algorithm inferior to our solution for any practical range of parameters. Moreover, as formalized in [ 13 ] and demonstrated in Section 7, for a wide range of scenarios our algorithm achieves constant stabilization time. Considering the severe fault model, we conclude that despite not being optimal, our algorithm performs satisfactory with respect to this quality measure. • Resilience : It is known that 3f + 1 nodes are necessary to tolerate f faults [ 25, 14 ] unless cryptographic tools are available. Since the complexity incurred by cryptographic tools is prohibit [SEP]'"
